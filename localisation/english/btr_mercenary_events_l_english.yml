 btr_mercenary.1.A:0 "Investigate."
 
 btr_mercenary.2.name:0 "[encountered_mercenary.GetName] Encountered"
 btr_mercenary.2.desc:0 "We have made first contact with the §H[encountered_mercenary.GetName]§!, a mercenary organisation, in the §H[mercenary_system.GetName]§! System.\n\nMercenaries are individuals that operate anywhere as long as there's profit to be had. They are available for hire to any government or organisation who require their services. They specialise in private security, convoy escort, assassinations, or anything requiring the use of force when a more 'official' military intervention cannot be sanctioned.\n\nTheir justifiable high price is often due to them using expensive weapons and equipment, and sourcing highly trained personnel, thus being as efficient and capable as possible.\n\nHowever, when not contracted, mercenaries will commonly raid remote outposts or starships, posing a significant risk to civilian and military assets alike."
 btr_mercenary.2.a:0 "Attempt to contact them."

 btr_mercenary.3.1.desc:0 "I am [blood_pack.GetRulerName], Blood Pack's representative when dealing with any organisation or individual seeking our mercenary services. We can offer you fleets, leaders or any kind of hired muscle you want, whether its hundreds of Vorcha or a few professionals who can do your dirty work quiet like.\n\nI warn you though, to not enter our territory, as any such act will be deemed as hostile."
 btr_mercenary.3.2.desc:0 "I represent the private security organisation Blue Suns. You may have already heard of our reputation for being both discreet and ruthlessly efficient, depending on the job. We aren't just some rabble like some other merc groups. We have a wide range of services we can offer your government, some small scale, some large, depending on your style and how 'messy' you want to be.\n\nDon't think about entering out territory though, as any vessels who do so will be destroyed. If you want to hire us it can be done so remotely."
 btr_mercenary.3.3.desc:0 "We are Cat6, a private military corporation. Our organisation has extensive experience in both large-scale fleet operations and discreet assassinations missions. Many of our members are ex-military and are also 'genetically enhanced', so you can expect highly trained professionals when using our services.\n\nAlso, don't be as foolish as others who have tried to enter our space, as any vessels who do will be destroyed."
 btr_mercenary.3.4.desc:0 "My name is [eclipse.GetRulerName], and I represent Eclipse. Our organisation generally favours stealth and 'intelligent' ways of conducting combat in order to fulfil our contracts, but we still offer larger scale operations when our clients require it.\n\nWe may not be as large as some other merc organisations, but we more than make up for this by using cutting edge equipment and weaponry, as well as our extensive use of biotics.\n\nI should also add that our territory is strictly of limits to outsiders."
