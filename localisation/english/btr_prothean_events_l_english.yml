 ILOS_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "Information gathered from a Prothean data disc has indicated that this planet contains a secret facility."

 ilos_dig_site:0 "Secret Prothean Installation"
 ilos_dig_site_desc:0 "This planet seems to be the location of the secret Prothean installation, this theory is further supported by the presence of multiple ruined Prothean cities littering the surface.\n\nFinding the entrance to the facility may prove difficult however, due to [btr_ilos_planet.GetName]'s level of destruction and decay."
 
 btr_ilos.1.name:0 "Secret Prothean Installation"
 btr_ilos.1.desc:0 "Recently, a civilian vessel commanded by several of our citizens has reported the discovery of an ancient Prothean data disc. They claimed they found it in some derelict ship wreckage they were salvaging. Unaware of the value of such a rare object, they sold it to a local government agency who then sent it our central historical research institute.\n\nFollowing intensive study, it was discovered that the disc contained coordinates to a 'top secret' Prothean facility located on a planet called [btr_ilos_planet.GetName].\n\nDue to the sensitivity of this discovery, we have limited the findings of the data disc to only top levels of the [Root.Owner.GetName] government.\n\nSo little is known about the Protheans, that finding a potentially untouched Prothean installation cannot be ignored. An expedition has been prepared to explore the planet. If we wish to get there first, we should not wait too long!"
 btr_ilos.2.name:0 "Arrival At [btr_ilos_planet.GetName]"
 btr_ilos.2.desc:0 "Our ship the [Root.GetName] has arrived at [btr_ilos_planet.GetName]. Following scans of the surface, the [Root.GetName] discovered the ruins of many Prothean cities on the surface. Unfortunately, it would appear most have already been looted, so we now know we were not the first to learn of the planet's existence. However, there is still a reasonable chance that this installation we are searching for, being top secret, has not be found by previous looters.\n\nWe will need to establish a permanent presence in the system if we wish to explore the surface further."
 btr_ilos.3.name:0 "Expedition Untenable"
 btr_ilos.3.desc:0 "Unfortunately, another empire has laid claim to the [btr_refuge_system.GetName] system which contains [btr_ilos_planet.GetName], the location of the secret Prothean facility. This has permanently halted our plans for our expedition."
 btr_ilos.4.name:0 "[btr_ilos_planet.GetName] Prothean Installation"
 btr_ilos.4.desc:0 "Our research team, led by Captain [Root.GetLeaderName], has landed near the centre a Prothean city located on a large continent positioned in the northern hemisphere of [btr_ilos_planet.GetName].\n\nThis city was selected arbitrarily, as the data disc we recovered gave no further information on the installation's location beyond specifying the planet. The team does however, possess several ground vehicles and recon drones, to allow them to quickly survey the surface for clues to the facilities whereabouts."
 btr_ilos.5.desc:0 "The city has indeed been picked bare, little of value remains after potential millennia of looting and scavenging by countless aliens. The team manage to find a some Prothean artifacts in a few remote places, most likely missed by previous scavengers due to the poor scanning equipment they were probably outfitted with.\n\nRealising the scope of searching all major Prothean cities on [btr_ilos_planet.GetName], Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] authorises additional teams be brought to the surface to help in the search.\n\nNow having spent weeks searching all of the major cities, all hope seemed lost until the [Root.GetName] reported that one of the many thousands of autonomous drones deployed to the surface has found something. The [Root.GetName]'s XO relays to [Root.GetLeaderName], on the surface, that the drone has detected a very weak energy reading deep below one of [btr_ilos_planet.GetName]'s cities. The reading is so weak that it was only detected when the drone was directly over it.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] now prepares to make landfall to collect [Root.GetLeaderName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] staff and transport them to the drone's location."
 btr_ilos.6.desc:0 "Potential safe landing zones are hard to find, so [Root.GetLeaderName] if forced to be dropped off a little way from the drone's location. The team press on without the support of their vehicles as the densely overgrown city streets prevent their passage.\n\nUp ahead a member of the exploration team makes visual contact with the drone, which is hovering in a large courtyard several feet of the ground.\n\nNow in the courtyard, [Root.GetLeaderName] links with the drone and downloads its survey data. Subterrain scans performed by the drone of the power source's location reveal a vast chamber deep underground. It seems likely this is the installation we are searching for.\n\nScans also reveal an elevator shaft leading to the installation. The team begin searching for its surface entrance."
 btr_ilos.7.desc:0 "The entrance of the elevator was not hard to locate, perhaps the idea was to hide it in plain sight, or maybe there was stronger security here before the Protheans died out.\n\nWhat seems closer to a miracle than just luck, the elevator still appears to be functional. One team member, a Prothean specialist, 'expertly' interacts with the control interface, though to the other members of the team it looks little more than mindless fumbling and random button pressing.\n\nEventually, the elevator springs to life and the team begin their long descent down to the facility."
 btr_ilos.8.desc:0 "2km below ground the elevator comes to a halt and the exploration team disembark. Working their way through the underground facility, they find it completely abandoned of Protheans, dead or otherwise. They do come to the conclusion however, that based on the mess of the facility, the Protheans left in a hurry.\n\nNow deeper in the installation, the team arrive at the vast chamber previous scans revealed. Lining the walls are potentially thousands of what look like stasis pods, maybe the Protheans never left at all. Before the team can start investigating the pods for signs of life, a holographic interface appears from a nearby terminal, and begins speaking to the team..."

 btr_ilos.10.name:0 "Vigil"
 btr_ilos.9.desc:0 "You are not Prothean. But you are not machine, either. This eventuality was one of many that was anticipated. This is why we sent our warning through the beacons.\n\nI do not sense the taint of indoctrination upon any of you. Perhaps there is still hope."
 btr_ilos.9.a:0 "How are you speaking our language?"
 btr_ilos.10.desc:0 "I have been monitoring your communications since you arrived at this facility. I have translated my output into a format you will comprehend.\n\nMy name is Vigil. You are safe here, for the moment. But that is likely to change. Soon, nowhere will be safe."
 btr_ilos.10.a:0 "What are you?"
 btr_ilos.10.b:0 "What is you purpose?"
 btr_ilos.10.c:0 "Get to the point!"
 btr_ilos.11.desc:0 "I am an advanced non-organic analysis system with personality imprints from Ksad Ishan, chief overseer of the [btr_ilos_planet.GetName] research facility."
 btr_ilos.12.desc:0 "You must break a cycle that has continued for millions of years. But to stop it, you must understand or you will make the same mistakes we did.\n\nThe Citadel is the heart of your civilisation and the seat of government. As it was with us, and as it has been with every civilisation that came before us.\n\nBut the Citadel is a trap. The station is actually an enormous mass relay. One that links to dark space, the empty void beyond the galaxy's horizon.\n\nWhen the Citadel relay is activated, the Reapers will pour through. And all you know will be destroyed. "
 btr_ilos.12.a:0 "How do the Reapers survive out in dark space?"
 btr_ilos.12.b:0 "The Reapers could wipe out the Citadel council in an instant!"
 btr_ilos.13.desc:0 "We have only theories. The researchers here came to believe the Reapers enter prolonged states of inactivity to conserve energy.\n\nThis allows them to survive the thousands and thousands of years it takes for organic civilisation to rebuild itself. But in this state, they are vulnerable.\n\nBy retreating beyond the edges of the galaxy, they ensure no one will accidentally discover them. They keep their existence hidden until the Citadel relay is activated."
 btr_ilos.14.desc:0 "That was our fate. Our leaders were dead before we even realised we were under attack. The Reapers seized control of the Citadel and through it, the mass relays.\n\nCommunication and transportation across our empire were crippled. Each star system was isolated, cut off from the others. Easy prey for the Reaper fleets.\n\nOver the next decades, the Reapers systematically obliterated our people. World by world, system by system, they methodically wiped us out."
 btr_ilos.14.a:0 "You didn't surrender?"
 btr_ilos.14.b:0 "All of you?"
 btr_ilos.15.desc:0 "No offer of surrender was ever given. Our enemy had a single goal, the extinction of all advanced organic life.\n\nTheir fleets advanced across every settled region of the galaxy. Some worlds were utterly destroyed. Others were conquered, their populations enslaved.\n\nThese indoctrinated servants became sleeper agents under Reaper control. Taken in as refugees by other Protheans, they betrayed them to the machines.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the Reapers had killed or enslaved every Prothean in the galaxy. They were relentless, brutal and absolutely thorough."
 btr_ilos.16.desc:0 "Through the Citadel, the reapers had access to all our records, maps census data. Information is power, and they knew everything about us.\n\nTheir fleets advanced across every settled region of the galaxy. Some worlds were utterly destroyed. Others were conquered, their populations enslaved.\n\nThese indoctrinated servants became sleeper agents under Reaper control. Taken in as refugees by other Protheans, they betrayed them to the machines.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the Reapers had killed or enslaved every Prothean in the galaxy. They were relentless, brutal and absolutely thorough."
 btr_ilos.16.a:0 "How did you manage to stay hidden?" 
 btr_ilos.17.desc:0 "All official records of our project were destroyed in the initial attack on the Citadel. While the Prothean empire came crashing down, [btr_ilos_planet.GetName] was spared.\n\nWe severed all communication with the outside and our facility went dark. The personnel retreated underground into these archives.\n\nTo conserve resources, everyone was put into cryogenic stasis. I was programmed to monitor the facility and wake the staff when the danger had passed."
 btr_ilos.17.a:0 "Did anyone survive?"
 btr_ilos.18.desc:0 "All official records of our project were destroyed in the initial attack on the Citadel. While the Prothean empire came crashing down, Ilos was spared.\n\nWe severed all communication with the outside and our facility went dark. The personnel retreated underground into these archives.\n\nTo conserve resources, everyone was put into cryogenic stasis. I was programmed to monitor the facility and wake the staff when the danger had passed.\n\nBut the genocide of an entire species is a long, slow process. Years passed. Decades, centuries. The Reapers persisted. And my energy reserves were dwindling."
 btr_ilos.19.desc:0 "Yes..."
 btr_ilos.19.a:0 "..."
 btr_ilos.22.desc:0 "None managed to survive the untold millennia they were in stasis for. Although this facilities power systems never failed, the stasis pods were never designed to last this long. One by one they failed, dooming those left inside.\n\nI have been running on reserve power, waiting for someone to find me, so I could warn them about the Reapers. Now that you have gained my knowledge, my purpose is complete.\n\nMy activation so that could speak to you has completely drained my last power reserves. It will not be long until I shut down. Forever.\n\nThe only information I have left to give is the location of a Prothean relic stored within this facility. I will transfer the data containing its location to you."
 btr_ilos.22.a:0 "Goodbye."
 btr_ilos.20.desc:0 "The Virtual intelligence shuts down and the chamber falls silent. Moments later all of the thousands of cryogenic stasis pod begin opening. One by one Protheans emerge from their millennia old slumber.\n\nConversing with the exploration team, the Prothean survivors are initially shocked by how much time has passed, but after a time they silently listen as the exploration team fill in recent history and the current status of the galaxy.\n\nAsked what their future plans are, the Prothean leaders state unamiously that they wish to begin rebuilding the Prothean Empire, and help as much as they can against the reaper threat.\n\nHow the re-emergence of the Prothean Empire, even in its extremely weakened state, will affect the galaxy, remains unclear..."
 btr_ilos.23.desc:0 "With that, Vigil fades away, finally going offline.\n\nThe team head to the provided coordinates and find a cash of Prothean artifacts, but more importantly, a Prothean Sphere. It must be what the VI was referring to."
