 btr_asrep_empire_modifier:0 "The Many Armies of the Asari Republics"
 btr_asrep_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Although answering to Thessian High Command, every republic, be it in Thessia itself or beyond, maintains its own army, with their own twist on command structure, equipment, training and tactics. Few things are common among all of them though, such as emphasis on quality over numbers, fluidity and mobility, biotic skills, guerilla tactics and training each skill to perfection over decades, if not hundreds of years of training and practice."
