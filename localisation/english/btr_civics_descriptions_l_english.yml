  btr_civic_foureyes_caste_desc:0 "Batarian people have traditionally lived under a rigid social hierarchy based on one self's wealth. This caste system has supposedly allowed them to thrive and prosper to such extent that all aliens envy their glorious nation: aristocrats rule to ensure that everyone is cared and provided for, and serfs work the land and industry. Some call it slavery, but surely that just shows their disrespect for the pride ways of the batarian people."
