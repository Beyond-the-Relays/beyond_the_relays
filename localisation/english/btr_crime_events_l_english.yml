 btr_den.01.desc:0 "Crime on this planet has gotten out of control and is no longer able to be ignored. A large portion of this seems to be coming from a cesspit of degeneracy and illegal behavior called “Chora’s Den”. While it is in theory a legitimate business, and no law enforcement raids have been able to conclusively prove a connection there are many who are growing tired of playing its game. An up-and-coming officer, a Lieutenant Puck, has advised that we shut down the establishment once and for all, scattering the various criminal rings that operate within it. Cut off from one another with no where to hide they may be easier to catch or just leave the station entirely. However, it may be an unpopular decision considering the legality of the business."
