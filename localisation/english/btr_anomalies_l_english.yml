 # Junthor (Ancient Obelisk)
 MEC_EG_ANO_JUNTHOR_1021_CAT:0 "Ancient Obelisk"
 MEC_EG_ANO_JUNTHOR_1021_CAT_DESC:0 "The recent survey of [From.GetName] by our science vessel has discovered an elaborate relief at the center of what appears to have been the capital of this planet. Translating it could give us greater insight to this planet's ancient inhabitants."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.name:0 "Translating the Ancient Obelisk"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.desc:0 "Our research team aboard the [Root.GetName] have completed the translation of the ancient relief. Disappointingly, it offers no answers and only raises more questions. \n\nOne side of the formalised text reads; 'Walk among these works, and know our greatness'. The other hastily scrawled, and rather forebodingly simply states; 'Monsters from the id'. The exact nature of these monsters are not described, nor any elaboration on if they could have been responsible for the ruinous state of the planet."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.a:0 "Let us hope these monsters are mere tales."

 # Rayingri (Collision Course)
 MEC_EG_ANO_RAYINGRI_1022_CAT:0 "Moon Oddity"
 MEC_EG_ANO_RAYINGRI_1022_CAT_DESC:0 "The survey of [From.GetName] has raised many questions regarding its orbit of Rayingri. Our science team wishes to investigate."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.name:0 "Collision Course"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.desc:0 "Our science team investigating [From.GetName] have concluded that this orbit is not a natural at all. It's clear that [From.GetName] is a rogue planetoid that likely entered the Gagarin system approximately ten thousand years ago. It is clear that [From.GetName] is in a decaying orbit and is nearing the end of it's spiral inwards towards Rayingri. It is estimated that within a couple centuries the gravity fields of the two bodies will rip each other apart. A spectacle that will surely be viewed by many."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.a:0 "A spectacular display awaits."

 ## Grissom
 # Zaherux (Sea of Sands)
 MEC_EG_ANO_ZAHERUX_1023_CAT:0 "Desert Marble"
 MEC_EG_ANO_ZAHERUX_1023_CAT_DESC:0 "Initial surveys of [From.GetName] indicate that the planet is a single massive desert of sand."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.name:0 "Sea of Sands"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.desc:0 "The initial surveys undertaken by the crew of the [Root.GetName] were correct. [From.GetName]'s surface consists of seas of loose silica dust, some kilometers deep, which swirl into global sandstorms. Unfortunately, many of our probes have been lost whilst studying this phenomena due to mechanical failure. A popular extranet meme quickly started getting passed around the crew insisting that the silica dust is actually nanobots created by a dead race to protect an ancient secret. Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was quick to dismiss these claims."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.a:0 "[From.GetName] is a swirling maelstrom of sand, and nothing more."

 # Pomal (Shallow Seas)
 MEC_EG_ANO_POMAL_1024_CAT:0 "Shallow Seas"
 MEC_EG_ANO_POMAL_1024_CAT_DESC:0 "Our recent survey of Pomal has revealed details which may indicate the past existence of shallow seas across its surface. Our science team wish to investigate further."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.name:0 "Forgotten Past"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.desc:0 "Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was correct in their assumption. [From.GetName] once hosted broad, shallow seas, across its surface. Most importantly, these seas were once teaming with life. Whilst many of the fossils found so far are no larger than half a meter in length, they are remarkably well preserved. Questions are being raised as to how a planet once teeming with life survived with such high temperatures. The likeliest answers are that the planet saw a major change in atmosphere, or the planet's orbit degraded. How such an event occured, however, will require further study. \n\nA research station in orbit to continue studying the fossilised remains and the planet's geological history has been requested."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.a:0 "Fossils of this planet's past are all that remains."

# Casbin (Pre-Garden World)
 MEC_EG_ANO_CASBIN_1025_CAT:0 "Building Blocks"
 MEC_EG_ANO_CASBIN_1025_CAT_DESC:0 "The survey of [From.GetName] has identified evidence of conditions indicative of a pre-garden world. Further analysis is warranted."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.name:0 "Pre-Garden World"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.desc:0 "After further investigation, Casbin has been found to be a classic pre-garden terrestrial world. Simple lichens and algae are likely to alter the hot, humid atmosphere mainly composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, into a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere over the next millenia. A research station would be beneficial in studying the evolution of [From.GetName] and its growing lifeforms. Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] highlights that it would be theoretically possible to hasten the process, and turn [From.GetName] into a garden world."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.a:0 "The birth of a new world is a sight to behold."

# Antibaar (Terraforming Candidate)
 MEC_EG_ANO_ANTIBAAR_1026_CAT:0 "Freezing Orb"
 MEC_EG_ANO_ANTIBAAR_1026_CAT_DESC:0 "Our survey of [From.GetName] has presented some interesting findings. Further analysis is required."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.name:0 "Terraforming Candidate"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is a cold terrestrial world with an atmosphere of methane and argon. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of iron with deposits of magnesium. However, if the planet's atmosphere was thickened it could become much more habitable. It should be considered a possible target for terraforming."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.a:0 "It may become a new home for future generations."
