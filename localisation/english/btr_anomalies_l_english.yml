 # Junthor (Ancient Obelisk)
 MEC_EG_ANO_JUNTHOR_1021_CAT:0 "Ancient Obelisk"
 MEC_EG_ANO_JUNTHOR_1021_CAT_DESC:0 "The recent survey of [From.GetName] by our science vessel has discovered an elaborate relief at the center of what appears to have been the capital of this planet. Translating it could give us greater insight to this planet's ancient inhabitants."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.name:0 "Translating the Ancient Obelisk"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.desc:0 "Our research team aboard the [Root.GetName] have completed the translation of the ancient relief. Disappointingly, it offers no answers and only raises more questions. \n\nOne side of the formalised text reads; 'Walk among these works, and know our greatness'. The other hastily scrawled, and rather forebodingly simply states; 'Monsters from the id'. The exact nature of these monsters are not described, nor any elaboration on if they could have been responsible for the ruinous state of the planet."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1021.a:0 "Let us hope these monsters are mere tales."

 # Rayingri (Collision Course)
 MEC_EG_ANO_RAYINGRI_1022_CAT:0 "Moon Oddity"
 MEC_EG_ANO_RAYINGRI_1022_CAT_DESC:0 "The survey of [From.GetName] has raised many questions regarding its orbit of Rayingri. Our science team wishes to investigate."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.name:0 "Collision Course"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.desc:0 "Our science team investigating [From.GetName] have concluded that this orbit is not a natural at all. It's clear that [From.GetName] is a rogue planetoid that likely entered the Gagarin system approximately ten thousand years ago. It is clear that [From.GetName] is in a decaying orbit and is nearing the end of it's spiral inwards towards Rayingri. It is estimated that within a couple centuries the gravity fields of the two bodies will rip each other apart. A spectacle that will surely be viewed by many."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1022.a:0 "A spectacular display awaits."

 ## Grissom
 # Zaherux (Sea of Sands)
 MEC_EG_ANO_ZAHERUX_1023_CAT:0 "Desert Marble"
 MEC_EG_ANO_ZAHERUX_1023_CAT_DESC:0 "Initial surveys of [From.GetName] indicate that the planet is a single massive desert of sand."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.name:0 "Sea of Sands"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.desc:0 "The initial surveys undertaken by the crew of the [Root.GetName] were correct. [From.GetName]'s surface consists of seas of loose silica dust, some kilometers deep, which swirl into global sandstorms. Unfortunately, many of our probes have been lost whilst studying this phenomena due to mechanical failure. A popular extranet meme quickly started getting passed around the crew insisting that the silica dust is actually nanobots created by a dead race to protect an ancient secret. Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was quick to dismiss these claims."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1023.a:0 "[From.GetName] is a swirling maelstrom of sand, and nothing more."

 # Pomal (Shallow Seas)
 MEC_EG_ANO_POMAL_1024_CAT:0 "Shallow Seas"
 MEC_EG_ANO_POMAL_1024_CAT_DESC:0 "Our recent survey of Pomal has revealed details which may indicate the past existence of shallow seas across its surface. Our science team wish to investigate further."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.name:0 "Forgotten Past"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.desc:0 "Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was correct in their assumption. [From.GetName] once hosted broad, shallow seas, across its surface. Most importantly, these seas were once teaming with life. Whilst many of the fossils found so far are no larger than half a meter in length, they are remarkably well preserved. Questions are being raised as to how a planet once teeming with life survived with such high temperatures. The likeliest answers are that the planet saw a major change in atmosphere, or the planet's orbit degraded. How such an event occured, however, will require further study. \n\nA research station in orbit to continue studying the fossilised remains and the planet's geological history has been requested."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1024.a:0 "Fossils of this planet's past are all that remains."

# Casbin (Pre-Garden World)
 MEC_EG_ANO_CASBIN_1025_CAT:0 "Building Blocks"
 MEC_EG_ANO_CASBIN_1025_CAT_DESC:0 "The survey of [From.GetName] has identified evidence of conditions indicative of a pre-garden world. Further analysis is warranted."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.name:0 "Pre-Garden World"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.desc:0 "After further investigation, Casbin has been found to be a classic pre-garden terrestrial world. Simple lichens and algae are likely to alter the hot, humid atmosphere mainly composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, into a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere over the next millenia. A research station would be beneficial in studying the evolution of [From.GetName] and its growing lifeforms. Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] highlights that it would be theoretically possible to hasten the process, and turn [From.GetName] into a garden world."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1025.a:0 "The birth of a new world is a sight to behold."

# Antibaar (Terraforming Candidate)
 MEC_EG_ANO_ANTIBAAR_1026_CAT:0 "Freezing Orb"
 MEC_EG_ANO_ANTIBAAR_1026_CAT_DESC:0 "Our survey of [From.GetName] has presented some interesting findings. Further analysis is required."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.name:0 "Terraforming Candidate"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is a cold terrestrial world with an atmosphere of methane and argon. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of iron with deposits of magnesium. However, if the planet's atmosphere was thickened it could become much more habitable. It should be considered a possible target for terraforming."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1026.a:0 "It may become a new home for future generations."

# Solveig (Birth of a Red Giant)
 MEC_EG_ANO_SOLVEIG_1051_CAT:0 "Unusual Readings"
 MEC_EG_ANO_SOLVEIG_1051_CAT_DESC:0 "Our science vessel in orbit of [From.GetName] has detected anomalous readings regarding the star's solar output. They wish to investigate further."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1051.name:0 "Birth of a Red Giant"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1051.desc:0 "The anomalous readings reported by [Root.GetLeaderName] have revealed that the star is evolving prematurely into a red giant. Our science team estimates that the star could undergo its transformation within the next millenia, though it could occur sooner. Whilst the star is unlikely to destroy its planetary bodies, it will undoubtedly be a major cosmic event to witness. [Root.GetLeaderName] wishes to deploy a permanent research outpost in the system to monitor the star."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1051.a:0 "One of the universes greatest events."

# Preying Mouth (Lost Ships)
 MEC_EG_ANO_PREYINGMOUTH_1061_CAT:0 "Automated Beacon"
 MEC_EG_ANO_PREYINGMOUTH_1061_CAT_DESC:0 "What appears to be an automated beacon has been found orbiting the gas giant, [From.GetName]."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1061.name:0 "Lost Ships"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1061.desc:0 "Despite the automated message being in an unknown alien language, it proved to be a relatively simple translation. The beacon contained an operational integrated translation virtual intelligence which proved invaluable and has already given much for our xenolinguistics department to interrogate. The device also alluded to the gas giant being a hotspot for lost ships with no known explanation. Detailed surveys of the gas giant and its orbit have found no debris, weapons or space-weather that could be responsible. It is possible that the beacon has been altered, or moved, or it could simply be a ruse to misdirect and deceive passing travelers."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1061.a:0 "An unusual mystery indeed."

# Bothros (Mass Extinction)
 MEC_EG_ANO_BOTHROS_1091_CAT:0 "Mass Extinction"
 MEC_EG_ANO_BOTHROS_1091_CAT_DESC:0 "Our survey of [From.GetName] has revealed evidence of a mass extinction event in the planet's past."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1091.name:0 "Mass Extinction"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1091.desc:0 "Our research teams have uncovered further details surrounding the mass extinction event on the planet Bothros. We have found evidence of a spacefaring civilization frozen in the equatorial ice, ranging from fragments of metal to preserved remains of the creatures wearing suits for extra-vehicular activity. \n\nFurther exploration has revealed that the habitation centers on [From.GetName] were vaporized by orbital bombardment, with no evidence to suggest any ground assault took place. The implications of simply reducing a colony to ash is worrying. \nThose that fled or happened to be away from the habitats during the attack were preserved in the ice, where they died of asphyxiation. It is likely that no aid came to the fallen colony, suggesting that this attack was likely part of a much wider conflict. \n\nThe unknown species are unlikely to have come from the nearby habitable world, but it is a possibility that they visited there. The homeworld of this species remains a mystery, as does the result of the conflict."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1091.a:0 "A terrible fate."

# Aegis (Rings of Aegis)
 MEC_EG_ANO_AEGIS_1092_CAT:0 "Rings of Aegis"
 MEC_EG_ANO_AEGIS_1092_CAT_DESC:0 "Our science vessel in orbit of [From.GetName] has found some interesting readings regarding the planet's rings."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1092.name:0 "Rings of Aegis"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1092.desc:0 "Further investigation has revealed that the rings surrounding the gas giant, [From.GetName], are likely from the planet itself. Our researchers believe that an extrasolar body measuring at least 200 square kilometers struck the planet, blasting enough dust and material into orbit to create a ring. The continued existence of the ring, after an estimated 1.8 million years, suggests that the volume of ejected material must have been monumental. Whilst the long-term benefits of this discovery are limited, it has caused excitement amongst our astrophysicists."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1092.a:0 "The destruction must have been immense."

# Etamis (Mass Extinction)
 MEC_EG_ANO_ETAMIS_1101_CAT:0 "Dead Garden World"
 MEC_EG_ANO_ETAMIS_1101_CAT_DESC:0 "Surveys of [From.GetName] has revealed evidence of a mass extinction event."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1101.name:0 "Mass Extinction"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1101.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is in a 'post-garden' state that clearly shows evidence of an orbital attack. While now waterless, the shores of former oceans show patterns of cratering too regular to be anything but saturation bombardment by dreadnought-class kinetic weapons. \nUnfortunately, our researchers have found little archeological evidence, with all settled regions being subject to bombardment. The few relics found suggest an advanced spacefaring culture that thrived on the world somewhere between 20 and 40 millions years ago. The level of antiquity makes it impossible to estimate the world's former population or guess whether it was the race's homeworld or colony. \nOur science team, unsurprisingly, wishes to establish a permanent research station."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1101.a:0 "An unfortunate  end."

# Vecchio (Alien Gravesite)
 MEC_EG_ANO_VECCHIO_1131_CAT:0 "Unnatural Landscape"
 MEC_EG_ANO_VECCHIO_1131_CAT_DESC:0 "Surveys of [From.GetName]'s mountain ranges have revealed a number of unnatural formations."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1131.name:0 "Alien Gravesite"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1131.desc:0 "The unnatural formations in the equatorial mountain range of [From.GetName] have been revealed to be a burial site. Ancient humanoid skeletons are prevalent throughout the cave network, though all are incomplete and poorly preserved. Our science officer is hopeful that together they may be able to form a complete skeleton of this dead race. Fragments of primitive ceramic goods have also been found nearby, further delighting our xeno-archeologists. Despite all this, our research team is questioning as to why such an inhospitable planet had these burial chambers in the first place, especially when there is a nearby habitable world in the system. Understandably, our science team wishes to set up a permanent research facility to investigate further."

# Hesano (Prothean Ship) 
 MEC_EG_ANO_HESANO_1132_CAT:0 "Shipwreck"
 MEC_EG_ANO_HESANO_1132_CAT_DESC:0 "During scans of [From.GetName], the wreckage of a starship was discovered. Preliminary research by our science team has led them to believe the ship may be Prothean."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1132.name:0 "Prothean Ship"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1132.desc:0 "Our science team aboard the [Root.GetName] were correct in their assumptions. The Prothean starship found in orbit of [From.GetName] has been fully mapped and explored revealing a cacophony of secrets. \n\nOur scientists believe that the ship was likely a science vessel, due to the lack of offensive weaponry and presumed laboratory spaces within the ship, though they cannot be entirely certain. The most important discovery, however, is that the ship has established that the Protheans were not a single species empire, but one with multiple species. Whilst we have been unable to ascertain the biological and sociological makeup of the crew, the living quarters has highlighted that the crew was dominated by humanoid species. Researchers believe that the vessel crewed upto two hundred personnel. \n\nUnsurprisingly, our researchers have demanded that a permanent facility be constructed to further investigate the wreck and the surrounding area."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1132.a:0 "We are one step closer to understanding the Protheans, and perhaps their disappearance."

 MEC_EG_ANO_ONTAROM_1141_CAT_DESC:0 "Our survey of [From.GetName] and its moons have revealed some interesting data."
 mec_eg_anomaly.1141.name:0 "Collision Course"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1141.desc:0 "The science vessel surveying [From.GetName] and its moons have found that the largest moon’s orbit has been slowly decaying. Its proximity is beginning to have tidal effects, and the dynamo-like revolution through Ontarom’s magnetic field is generating increasingly powerful electrical storms. It is estimated that the two bodies will collide with each other within the next 3,000 years. Despite this, the planet is suited for habitation, and any prospective colony would be able to gather large amounts of data and research on the effects of such a unique interaction on magnetic fields, atmosphere, electronics and organic life."

 mec_eg_anomaly.1151.name:0 "Synthetic Rings"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1151.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is already a somewhat unique habitable world, being tidally locked to its parent star, but with the discovery of a planetary ring only visible from the surface, the planet is truly one of a kind. Further investigation has found that the ring is likely an alien art installation on a massive scale. The rings are made of small pieces of synthetic material that are almost invisible from space. From the ground, they catch and scatter the light of the system’s star in picturesque ways. So far, there has been no clue as to when the ring was created and by who."

 mec_eg_anomaly.1171.name:0 "Ancient Starship"
 mec_eg_anomaly.1171.desc:0 "The debris across [From.GetName] has led to the discovery of an ancient starship. Our science team believes that the starship was fired upon, resulting in its collision with the moon. This is likely due to the stern engines of the vessel having been obliterated by kinetic weaponry. However the rest of the ship is in relatively good condition. \nMeasuring at roughly 400 meters in length, though lacking a spinal mass accelerator, it is likely that the ship was a civilian vessel. Interestingly, the ship's layout suggests that the species operating the vessel were horizontally-oriented, though no bodies were found in the wreckage. The remains were likely retrieved at some point in the distant past. \nNonetheless, the vessel, whilst not any more advanced than our own, has provided some interesting engineering insights."

 mec_eg_anomaly.1261.desc:0 "Further scans of [From.GetName], and its neighbouring planet, have not only concluded that they are in a shared synchronous orbit, but that they also share an atmosphere. Whilst one could not use an atmospheric vehicle to fly between the two planets, they do transfer atmosphere and particulate between each other. This causes incredibly powerful weather and electrical storms to occur across both planetary bodies. Our researchers wish to establish a facility in orbit to study this unique phenomena."
