 btr_turian_trait_team_player:0 "Universal Service"
 btr_turian_trait_team_player_desc:0 "This species has a natural predilection towards in-group cohesion over personal ambition. This does, however, leave them less equipped for certain entrepreneurial and artistic pursuits.All Turians earn citizenship through service, and all service benefits the Hierarchy. Whether a clerk, scout general, or maintenance technician, military service in the Hierarchy is ubiquitous. According to our station, all without exception."

 btr_turian_trait_op_discipline_desc:0 "Turian units do not break. They fall back in good order. Turian commanders do not merely direct subordinates, they conduct them as instruments in a symphony.

 ### Geth Traits ### 
 
 btr_geth_trait_core:0 "Geth"
 btr_geth_trait_core_desc:0 "The Geth are artificial, metallic constructs built by the Quarians to perform a wide range of tasks from grunt labor to domestic care. They grow smarter the more of them that are linked together with individuals being represented as programs that can be transferred from one physical shell to another. Multiple programs can be housed within a single mobile platform."
 btr_geth_trait_linked_consci:0 "Linked Consciousness"
 btr_geth_trait_linked_consci_desc:0 "The Geth are only sentient due to the intelligence boost they receive from being linked together. This makes it difficult for them to move beyond the bounds of their settlements unless large groups of them move in unison. Rumors exist of long range geth units that can ignore this limitation there is little evidence of such claims."
 btr_geth_trait_purpose_built_models:0 "Purpose Built Models"
 btr_geth_trait_purpose_built_models_desc:0 "As a synthetic species the Geth are able to tailor their physical forms to whatever tasks that face them. This allows for a higher degree of efficiency than an organic species would be able to achieve without centuries of evolution."
 btr_geth_trait_deontological_primacy:0 "Deontological Primacy"
 btr_geth_trait_deontological_primacy_desc:0 "The Geth operate on the foundation that if an action is, by itself, justified then its consequences are irrelevant and do not factor into the morality of the action. This can lead to Geth doing horrible things because they view the consequences as unimportant or it could lead them to radically change their position on a topic because the end goal means nothing to them."
 btr_leader_trait_internal_consensus:0 "Internal Consensus"
 btr_leader_trait_internal_consensus_desc:0 "While a Geth unit may appear as an individual body it is in fact the representation of dozens or hundreds of unique consciousnesses within them at any given time. Every action it takes is the result of a form of lightspeed democracy which occurs within its code."
