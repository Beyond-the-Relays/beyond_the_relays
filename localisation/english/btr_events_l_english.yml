 ### Citadel Discovery ###

 btr_citadel.1.name:0 "Citadel Discovery"
 btr_citadel.1.desc:0 "We have encountered an enormous space station in the [citadel_system.GetName] system. Preliminary scans performed by the [Root.GetFleetName] indicate it to be over 40km long, and ancient, possibly tens of thousands of years old."
 btr_citadel.1.a:0 "Amazing."
 btr_citadel.1.b:0 "We should investigate."
 citadel_dig_site:0 "Citadel Exploration"
 citadel_dig_site_desc:0 "Further scans indicate the station to be similar in design to the Mass Relays we've encountered, leading to theory that it was also constructed by the ancient Protheans.\n\nA team will need to board the construct if we intend to learn any further information."
 btr_citadel.2.name:0 "Citadel Exploration"
 btr_citadel.2.desc:0 "Moving into the heart of the station, the crew of the [Root.GetFleetName] observe massive city like structures littering the five 'arms' of the station, though for now, they appear to be lifeless. The crew also notice a degradation in the ship's sensors, whatever unknown material this station is made of, seems to prevent scanning beams from penetrating it.\n\nDocking ports and hangars are dotted around the central ring of the station, they would seem the best point of entry."
 btr_citadel.2.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_citadel.3.desc:0 "Docking with the station, the crew of the [Root.GetFleetName] disembark. The hangar bay seems to spring to life, with a multitude of lights illuminating, and a soft humming sound of machinery and inner workings permeating the room.\n\nProceeding through the hangar airlock, the crew are greeted by strange insect like quadruped aliens. They seem harmless, but they are unable to communicate. Preliminary observations indicate that their role seems to be that of some kind of guardian.\n\nThe crew will continue their exploration."
 btr_citadel.3.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_citadel.4.desc:0 "Analysis shows the interior atmosphere of the station to be composed of main parts nitrogen and oxygen, quite breathable for our species. The gravity is also a comfortable 1.02 standard G's, and the ambient temperature is 23°C, it almost seems made for our species.\n\nEntering in the core of the ring structure, the crew discover a massive park like complex wrapping around the entirety of the ring. Obviously unused for some time, it is still in excellent condition, with the flora and artificial lakes being quite tidy, no doubt the work of the only native inhabitants, now dubbed 'Keepers' by the crew of the [Root.GetFleetName]."
 btr_citadel.4.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_citadel.5.desc:0 "Originally observing a tower type structure on their arrival to the station, the crew believe it likely to be the main control centre for the station, and now make its exploration their top priority. Taking an elevator to the top of the tower, the teams assumption proves correct, what appears to be a control centre is found, indicated by a multitude of inactive computer terminals.\n\nActivating one, the interface is immediately recognisable as Prothean. Interrogating the computer for the location of the central core of the station, as this control centre only seems to have limited access, none is found, either a result of computer degradation or it being deliberately hidden from us.\n\nThe name of the station is also found in the records; 'Citadel'."
 btr_citadel.5.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_citadel.6.desc:0 "Further exploration of the tower reveals a massive council chamber and associated governmental offices connected by a series of corridors and passageways, could this be the seat of the Prothean government? This theory would seem quite logical, based on what limited information we have on the Prothean Empire, we know they controlled the majority of the galaxy around 50,000 years ago, and the Citadel's location is strategically located at the heart of the Relay network.\n\nRecording their findings, the crew of the [Root.GetFleetName] prepare to explore the 'arms' of the station."
 btr_citadel.6.a:0 "Continue."
 btr_citadel.7.desc:0 "The 'arms' of the Citadel seem to constitute the residential area of the station, housing hundreds of skyscrapers, they could theoretically support a population in the millions.\n\nInvestigating countless apartments, they are all completely absent from any form of habitation, there are no personal artifacts inside, they are completely gutted. Whether they were emptied before the Protheans left or were made this way by the Keepers is unclear."
 btr_citadel.7.a:0 "Intriguing."
 btr_citadel.8.desc:0 "Finishing their exploration, the crew of the [Root.GetFleetName] return to the hangar and prepare to board their ship. Reporting their findings to the [Root.Owner.GetName], there are many questions left unanswered, why was it abandoned? What are these keepers? Where is the central core of the station?\n\nWhile it will be up to the central government to decide whether it should be colonised, based on the preliminary exploration and the suitability for the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] species, the citadel sure does seem inviting."
 btr_citadel.8.a:0 "Understood."

 ### Mars Ruins ###

 btr_mars.1.name:0 "Martian Expedition"
 btr_mars.1.desc:0 "Several outposts near the Promethei Planum region on Mars have reported strange magnetic phenomena in area. When several ground-based vehicles were dispatched to investigate, they were never heard from again, it is theorised that the local interference rendered them immobile and disrupted communications.\n\nA plan has been devised for an expedition to the region to discover the source of the phenomenon, and prevent the loss of further equipment and personnel."
 btr_mars.1.a:0 "Send a team to investigate."
 btr_mars.1.b:0 "It is of no concern."
 mars_dig_site:0 "Martian Ruins"
 mars_dig_site_desc:0 "After reports of strange magnetic phenomena near Mar's southern pole, the [Root.Owner.GetName] has authorised an expedition to the region to discover its source.\n\nA preliminary base camp has been established, along with specially shielded vehicles, which should protect them from the interference effects. The ground teams now await the arrival of the expedition leader."
 btr_mars.2.name:0 "Martian Ruins"
 btr_mars.2.desc:0 "Successfully landing at the base camp, Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] meets with the rest of the expedition team, and begins preparing plans to explore the region. Orbital scans conducted by the [Root.GetFleetName] indicate the heaviest concentration of interference to be 100km south of their current position.\n\nLoading their supplies and scientific equipment into the four vehicles, the team prepare to move out."
 btr_mars.2.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_mars.3.desc:0 "Now within 10km of the source, the team's sensors are now able to get clearer readings of the now increased interference. What appears to be an incredibly powerful energy signature, surrounded by an unknown, but equally intense field, in detected ahead.\n\nNow within visual range, the team are able to make out a crater directly over the energy source. Driving into the crater, high powered surveying scans are directed deep underground, to try and map what lies beneath the surface. Now revealed, is an artificial structure of unknown design and material composition. The team now prepare to disembark and to attempt to access the structure."
 btr_mars.3.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_mars.4.desc:0 "Satisfied that their armoured suits will protect them from most dangerous effects of the inference and energy, the expedition team spread out over the crater in hopes of finding an entrance. It doesn't take long a junior member of the team to discover, using their arm mounted scanner and interface, a shaft and corresponding hatch leading vertically from just beneath the surface to the structure below.\n\nDeploying the beam-based mining equipment, it takes only moments for the earth and rock to be stripped away and the entrance be revealed. The majority of the team crowd around the metallic hatch, before Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] reaches for a handle type object and opens it. The team prepare to descend inside."
 btr_mars.4.a:0 "Continue."
 btr_mars.5.desc:0 "It is soon clear whoever built this facility, it wasn't [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]s. Scans of the structure reveal it to be constructed out of an advanced metal composite and to be in excess of 50,000 years old. Based on the size and ergonomics of the ladder and shaft the team were descending, the aliens who build this facility were physiologically similar to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]s. Being a bipedal species with two arms and around the same height as the average [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]. This wouldn't come as much surprise to many xeno-scientists back on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName], as it has been theorised for quite some time that [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] physiology is the logical evolution of an advanced species, so it makes sense that any comparable alien species would evolve in a similar why.\n\nArriving at the bottom of the shaft, the team shine their flashlights around the intersection of dark corridors. Faced with multiple options for a root to take, Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] makes the decision to take the right-hand corridor, as scans indicate it to lead to the previously detected energy source."
 btr_mars.5.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_mars.6.desc:0 "Proceeding through the alien facility, the team come to the conclusion, after surveying several rooms en route, that it was hastily abandoned by the original inhabitants. The corridors and rooms are messy, with containers and other pieces of equipment strewn about. Trying to access, what appear to be computer terminals, proves fruitless, as the incredible age has degraded them beyond repair. Examining what looks like the aliens living quarters, reveals them to have quite a spartan lifestyle, with few personal objects and extremely functional living amenities. Whether this a unique practice for this and similar facilities or widespread across their entire race is unclear.\n\nHanging on the wall of a larger living quarters, possibly those of someone in authority, is an artistic rendition of an alien being, believing it to be of the aliens inhabiting this facility, the team examine it closer. The expedition team's previous assumptions about the aliens appearance proves to be correct. Largely similar to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]s, its main difference being; two pairs of eyes in its thick, layered carapace head, and two large toes in its feet. Imaging the painting for the expedition records, the team again make their way towards the energy source."
 btr_mars.6.a:0 "Amazing!"
 btr_mars.7.desc:0 "Now nearing the energy source, the team hear a stong pulsating sound from its suspected location. Prying open a damaged door, the team enter a large cavernous room illuminated by a pulsating blue light, the first sign of the facilities functionality, since the expedition entered. It is now clear what is causing the potent energy and interference, suspended in the centre of the room is some kind of alien reactor core! Carefully approaching the core, scans indicate it be malfunctioning, most likely due to its incredible age, but at no risk of becoming unstable. The team is shocked, as the core, powered by an unknown source, is producing over 50,000 megawatts, nearly forty times as much as the most advanced nuclear power plant on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]!"
 btr_mars.7.a:0 "Incredible!"
 btr_mars.8.desc:0 "Within the room, the expedition discover a few, still functioning, computer interfaces. Though very alien, the team are able to interpret some of the information they are viewing. The alien reactor is in fact called a 'Mass Effect Core' which is generating a 'Mass Effect Field', whose erratic functioning is responsible for the magnetic phenomena experienced across the region, it is also apparently powered by 'Element Zero'. The name of the alien race is also discovered; 'Prothean'.\n\nSplitting up, half of the team stay and attempt to access more of the alien data, while the rest continue to explore the facility. Gaining access to an even larger room, the team discover a massive subterranean hangar bay, whose large, no longer functioning, blast doors open to the Martian surface. A small craft is located in the corner of the hangar, the team theorise it to be a shuttle craft analogue, why it was left behind is unknown."
 btr_mars.8.a:0 "Understood."
 btr_mars.9.desc:0 "The other half of the team continue to sift through the alien data, when one team member calls for Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] to come and view their terminal. Viewing what appears to be a live representation of the Sol system, highlighted on the edge of the solar system, just beyond the dwarf planet Pluto, is what seems to be an alien ship or station. Unable to learn further information about it from the confusing alien interface, Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] makes note of it, as top priority to include in [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] report.\n\nIt is clear that the limited expedition team does not have sufficient resources to properly investigate the entire facility or assimilate the massive amounts of alien data on the computer. While the majority of the team stay within the alien base, Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] and a few others head to the surface to try and make contact with [Root.Owner.GetName] Command to inform them of their progress. They also recommend for a permanent research base to be established to study the facility and a ship sent to investigate the alien station near Pluto."
 btr_mars.9.a:0 "Excellent work."
 btr_pluto.1.name:0 "Charon Relay"
 btr_pluto.1.desc:0 "Based on the recommendations of the expedition team on Mars, a ship was sent to investigate the location of a possible Prothean space station near Pluto.\n\nWhen our vessel arrived, it detected the aforementioned alien space station buried in Pluto's moon; Charon. It will take time to repair and study, but [Root.Owner.GetName] scientists hope in time, they will learn all of its secrets."
 btr_pluto.1.a:0 "Excellent."

 ### Tuchanka Restoration ###

 btr_tuchanka.1.desc:0 "Following an incredible amount of effort, cooperation and resources, Nakmor City has been restored to its former glory as the capital of [tuchanka_planet.GetName].\n\nThanks to more 'forward thinking' [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]s, many now hope that the rest of the barren surface of [tuchanka_planet.GetName] could one day be brought back to its once habitable state."

My team and I have recently finished installing our basic equipment inside the facility. Now that this has been completed, we are ready to begin research on a scientific field of your choice.\n\nThis facility can focus on §HWeapons§! research. As this facility is isolated, and far away from any civilian centres, we can experiment with more dangerous and volatile weapon concepts, than we could on one of our colonies.\n\nMy team could instead focus on §HGenetic§! experimentation and modification on [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] test subjects. Although the immediate enhancements would be relatively minor, it could have massive implications on the future development of our species in the long term."

The immune system creates an antibody to destroy pathogens in mid-air by altering their genetic code, even working at distance. An unintended side effect of this was, the test subject's immune system will not only seek out pathogens but, as part of its active defence, also attack the DNA of those not genetically modified, resulting in their death.\n\nBy the time [new_noveria_scientist.GetName] and [new_noveria_scientist.GetHerHis] team realised this, all but a few of the team were infected by the test subjects. In an attempt to contain the outbreak, [new_noveria_scientist.GetName] evacuated the uninfected team members, and initiated the facility's self-destruct."

We named them Geth.\n\nThrough our desire to make them more sophisticated and advanced, we started modifying and improving them, the result being they eventually achieved sentience. Panicked, the Quarian Government on Rannoch, our homeworld, ordered the immediate termination of all Geth in the hopes of preventing a revolution. However, the sophistication of the Geth's neural network was severely underestimated, and the Geth reacted to defend themselves.\n\nThe resulting war cost billions of Quarian lives, eventually our surviving ancestors fled Rannoch aboard this fleet, where we have lived ever since. The 17 million Quarians aboard this Flotilla is all that remains of our race."
 migrant_fleet.10.a:0 "Why don't you simply colonise another planet?"
 migrant_fleet.13.desc:0 "Were it that simple. Unlike your race, our immune systems are extremely weak, which is why we have to wear these enviro-suits. We evolved this way due to our homeworld having very few pathogenic microbes compared to similar planets. What few viruses and other microbes native to our homeworld were often at least partly beneficial to us, giving us a symbiotic relationship with our environment.\n\nFurthermore, most Quarians are united in the dream of someday retaking Rannoch from the Geth.\n\nSo, you see it is not so simple."

 migrant_fleet.14.desc:0 "I cannot discuss any classified military plans with outsiders as it may put the Migrant Fleet at risk, such an action would also be deemed treasonous.\n\nI can say however, that I don't know how you feel about your own homeworld, but we Quarians care for ours deeply. "
 migrant_fleet.14.a:0 "I see."
 migrant_fleet.11.desc:0 "Yes, this is true, due to the hard life we live in the Flotilla many Quarians have acquired unique skills in order to cope will their existences. Because of this, many consider us masters at maintaining and converting technology, especially ship parts. Our mining techniques are also unrivalled, as the Migrant Fleet requires so much fuel, we have to dedicate much of our time to mining operations.\n\nIf you are interested, we have many Quarians looking for opportunities that suit their skill sets, in order to fulfil part of their Pilgrimages."
