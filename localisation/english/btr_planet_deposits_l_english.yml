 ### Asari Republics
 
 btr_d_asrep_armali:0 "Republic of Armali"
 btr_d_asrep_armali_desc:0 "One of the most powerful republics on Thessia, it can trace its origins to Athame herself. Whilst the archeological ruins within the republic continue to draw millions of visitors each year, it is in fact Armali's businesses that are the source of its wealth.Having been at the forefront of technology and science over the past centuries, the city has the highest concentration of tech companies of any republic on Thessia. Their influence and wealth rival that of dozens of smaller republics and ensure that Armali remains the premier location for investment and business."
 btr_d_asrep_nosdesera:0 "Nos Desera"
 btr_d_asrep_nosdesera_desc:0 "Famous for the Tasar Helini, the tallest shopping complex on Thessia, and its prime filming location, Nos Desera is considered to be the epicentre of Thessia's vid and music industry. The volume of credits moving through Nos Desera is considered to be on par with some of the largest republics, however, the reliance on a few key industries has limited Nos Desera's power and influence. Despite this, Nos Desera uses its access to Thessia's famous to its advantage, with some of the strictest privacy laws on Thessia, and low tax rates, the rich and famous are more than happy to promote Nos Desera as a top tourist destination."
 btr_d_asrep_serrice_univ:0 "The University of Serrice"
 btr_d_asrep_serrice_univ_desc:0 "The University of Serrice is considered to be the principal university on Thessia, most notably in the fields of biotics, archeology and astrophysics. Anyone lucky enough to be accepted into the university is almost guaranteed to succeed for the rest of their life, with many of their former students having been, and continuing to be involved in the most prestigious projects throughout asari space."
 btr_d_asrep_cresyl_plateau:0 "Cresyl Plateau"
 btr_d_asrep_cresyl_plateau_desc:0 "Formed during the Diodechus Period, the Cresyl Plateau is a 130km region that was once submerged under the ocean. As a result, the plateau is teeming with fossils, minerals and carbon. Whilst the majority of the region is now protected due to its outstanding natural beauty, some areas are still excavated for resources. This region continues to fuel the development of local settlements and has been vital in the development of the Asphine industrial complex. Recent estimates predict that the region could provide another thousand years worth of minerals."
 btr_d_asrep_askasian_mountains:0 "Askasian Mountains"
 btr_d_asrep_askasian_mountains_desc:0 "The Askasian mountain range is home to Thessia's highest peaks, as well as its most treacherous terrain. Whilst tens of thousands have now climbed to the summit of Mount Jithri, the mountain still maintains its difficulty and notoriety. Recent geological surveys have found an abundance of mineral resources deep below the range. The quantity and quality of these minerals will ensure that Thessia has a constant supply of raw resources for centuries to come. Careful excavations are underway to ensure that the mountain range above does not destabilize from any mining operations."
 btr_d_asrep_senecan_lakes:0 "Senecan Lakes"
 btr_d_asrep_senecan_lakes_desc:0 "The northern lakes of the Seneca region are renowned for their natural beauty, as well as their vital importance to the Republic of Ovida. The lakes alone are estimated to be responsible for nearly 15% of Ovidas national income due to tourism and irrigation to neighboring republics. In recent history, concerns grew as to the overexploitation of the lakes, with a memoriam put in place which saw an immediate ban on fishing and irrigation, nearly decimating the local agricultural industry. Now, however, the lakes are beginning to flourish once more with continued strict resource management and care."
 btr_d_asrep_pulian_delta:0 "Pulian Delta"
 btr_d_asrep_pulian_delta_desc:0 "Since the advent of asari civilization, the Pulian Delta has been a vital region for agriculture due to its fertility and biodiversity. Estimated to provide up to 8% of Thessia's food, the region has been fought over and controlled by hundreds of different nations throughout history. It was not until the formation of modern e-democracies that the region was given special recognition and came to be considered the universal birthright of all asari, placed under the jurisdiction of a neutral council."
 btr_d_asrep_irssal_tea:0 "Irssal Tea"
 btr_d_asrep_irssal_tea_desc:0 "The irssal plant is known across Thessia for its beautiful and vivid flowers, but most importantly, for its sweet smell and taste, Whilst the tea is easily available across Thessia, it remains a favourite due to its timeless aroma and simplicity. Maiden and Matriarch alike will be found sipping irssal tea whilst enjoying the view of the Armali skyline."
 btr_d_asrep_eezo_deposits:0 "Element Zero Deposits"
 btr_d_asrep_eezo_deposits_desc:0 "The planet is awash in all forms of eezo present in water, soil, flora and even fauna, with many native lifeforms having evolved either biotic mutations or immunity. Eezo makes up the backbone of Thessia's economy and sees ubiquitous use in many industrial, medicinal, scientific and consumer areas. Non-biotically adapted tourists are advised to stick to the visitors menu, as even food and drink on Thessia are typically served with small amounts of element zero."
 btr_d_asrep_thessia_net:0 "Thessia Planetary Network"
 btr_d_asrep_thessia_net_desc:0 "Thessia's extensive communications infrastructure synergizes digital and physical networking to create a world of infinite connectivity. With free, omnipresent and nearly uninterruptible access to the planetary internet, the network permeates all aspects of culture, politics and economy, leading to the development of a society so dependent upon social media, digital trade and networked amenities that, to many, the prospect of getting disconnected from the network would be an apocalyptic event.The communications infrastructure was instrumental to the establishment of the modern asari government - a form of electronic democracy in which a mosaic of local and global communities would govern themselves directly without relying on elected officials. Instead, political authority would be based on one's charisma, reputation, merits and experience; the course of debates often directed by influential matriarchs and, to a lesser but notable extent, popular celebrities."
 btr_d_asrep_zalis_spill:0 "Zalis Chemical Spill"
 btr_d_asrep_zalis_spill_desc:0 "A privately owned chemical processing plant in the Zalis sea underwent an emergency shutdown procedure when three of the five chemical tanks began to see a significant rise in pressure. Despite the emergency shutdown, the tanks were unable to divert the needed pressure to prevent an explosion. The resulting breach unleashed over a hundred million liters of methyl isocyanate which subsequently dissolved in the sea.The local fishing and tourism industry were shut down overnight with a forty kilometer exclusion zone put into immediate effect. Many nearby cities and towns saw their livelihoods collapse. An investigation into the disaster found that cost-cutting exercises were undertaken, including the pressure valves on the tanks. The corporation involved, ZFC Industries, and the majority of its executives were found guilty of a variety of crimes for their actions."
 btr_d_asrep_zalis_sea:0 "Zalis Sea"
 btr_d_asrep_zalis_sea_desc:0 "The Zalis Sea is teeming with life once again, with a large variety of creatures returning to their ancestral homes.

The local settlements are once again seeing their towns and lives improve as tourists flock to see the beautiful fauna and flora flourishing beneath the waves."
 btr_d_asrep_yisrin:0 "Devastated Republic of Yisrin"
 btr_d_asrep_yisrin_desc:0 "For over two millennia the former Republic of Yisrin stood tall amongst the cliffs of the Lifilo coast until a major earthquake destroyed much of the city. With over four hundred thousand dead and millions of refugees; the city still stands abandoned.Unfortunately, the quake also caused significant damage to the Lifilo tidal barrage, which is situated at the mouth of the Yasarow river. With enough investment the tidal barrage may once again be operational, ensuring that the region may begin the process of rebuilding the abandoned republic."
 btr_d_asrep_tidal_barrage:0 "Lifio Tidal Barrage"
 btr_d_asrep_tidal_barrage_desc:0 "After a monumental investment into the Lifilo tidal barrage, and the city of Yisrin, the republic is beginning to return to its former glory. In thanks for the efforts of their asari sisters, the Republic of Yisrin is investing in developing the Lifilo tidal barrage even further. Capable of producing enough energy to power four neighboring cities, the tidal installation is on its way to becoming one of the greatest engineering marvels on Thessia."

 btr_d_turhie_hot_spots:0 ""Hot Spots""
 btr_d_turhie_hot_spots_desc:0 "Palaven’s weak magnetic field is as much a blessing as it is a curse. Certain areas of the planet receive significantly more solar radiation from Trebia due to the planets orbital and rotational cycles.
