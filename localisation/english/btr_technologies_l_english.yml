 ### SETUP TECHNOLOGIES ###
 tech_production_increase:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 tech_production_increase_desc:0 "You know how life is short and everything well time is shorter in Stellaris and the Realism is hard so we increased production for every empire <3"
 ### RARE RESOURCES ###

 tech_mine_element_zero:0 "Element Zero Mining"
 tech_mine_element_zero_desc:0 "Element Zero is often only formed in systems with Neutron stars and Pulsars. As these are dangerous places to mine, it usually requires extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to survive the intense radiation."
 tech_mine_helium_3:0 "Helium-3 Extraction"
 tech_mine_helium_3_desc:0 "Helium-3 can often be found in the atmospheres of gas giants, from where it can be easily and cheaply skimmed."

 ### MASS EFFECT DRIVES ###
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1:0 "Element Zero Core Infusion"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1_desc:0 "When Element Zero is subjected to an electrical current, it releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a Mass Effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. This effectively raises the speed of light within the Mass Effect field, allowing high speed travel with negligible relativistic time dilation effects. This can be applied to our FTL drives to greatly improve efficiency."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2:0 "Element Zero Concentration"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2_desc:0 "Further research into the effects of Element Zero on our FTL drives has revealed potential improvements. By concentrating Element Zero into a purer form, it results in a notable decrease to the mass of a starship, further increasing FTL velocities."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3:0 "Element Zero Experiementation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3_desc:0 "By combining Element Zero with different quantum and subatomic particles, we are able to improve the efficiency of our Element Zero infused FTL cores by at least 10 percent."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4:0 "Mass Effect Field Stabilisation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4_desc:0 "Until now, Mass Effect fields generated by Element Zero have been naturally unstable when ships are travelling at extreme FTL velocities. However, further particle physics research has given us a better understanding of how these fields are formed. This research has allowed ships to safely surpass previous speed limitations."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5:0 "Element Zero FTL Limits"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5_desc:0 "Continued experimentation on FTL drives infused with Element Zero has recently been quite slow. Our scientists have made a few minor improvements to our current generation of FTL drives but have warned us further research is unlikely to return major results. However, they have proposed that we stop trying to improve standard FTL drives and instead construct a pure Element Zero drive core. We have been warned that this will be a long and resource intensive task however."
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction:0 "Element Zero Extraction"
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction_desc:0 "Eezo is generated when solid matter, such as a planet, is affected by the energy of a star going supernova. The material is common in the asteroid debris that orbits neutron stars and pulsars. These are dangerous places to mine, requiring extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to survive the intense radiation from the dead star. We now know how to safely harvest this volatile resource."
 element_zero_deficit:0 "Element Zero Deficit"

 ### Asari Republics Technology
 
 btr_tech_asrep_ship_design:0 "Ship Design Philosophy of the Republics"
 btr_tech_asrep_ship_design_desc:0 "Asari ships embody the quality over quantity doctrine, with every ship being faster, more armored, better shielded, packed to the brim with the latest technology and heavier armed than any other of the same class in the galaxy as well as being substantially more expensive both to produce and upkeep, price no other but the Republics could pay."
 btr_tech_asrep_asari_arch:0 "Asari Architecture"
 btr_tech_asrep_asari_arch_desc:0 "Beautiful, sleek, elegant yet fully functional, Thessian towers have stood their place for thousands of years, a testament to the expertise of galaxy renowned Asari architects and builders."

 ### Turian Hierarchy Technology

 btr_tech_turhie_elkoss:0 "Elkoss Combine Fleet Support Contract"
 btr_tech_turhie_elkoss_desc:0 "Integrating Elkoss Combine engineering and operations technicians into our anchorages and shipyards will greatly assist in streamlining maintenance of our grand fleet. "
 btr_tech_turhie_fleet_in_being:0 "Fleet in Being Doctrine"
 btr_tech_turhie_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "The Turian Navy is the guarantor of peace and security in council space, and our most important bargaining chip in galactic affairs. If the fleet loses its primacy, so too does the Hierarchy."
 
 ### Geth Consensus Technology
 
 btr_tech_getcon_uv_pd_laser:0 "Ultra-Violet Antifighter Laser"
 btr_tech_getcon_uv_pd_laser_desc:0 "The Geth are unique in their use of an Ultraviolet antifigher laser instead of the less power intense Infrared used by most organic militaries. Despite requiring more power it is also more effective."
 btr_tech_getcon_geth_sphere_phys:0 "Geth Sphere"
 btr_tech_getcon_geth_sphere_phys_desc:0 "The Geth have long wished to be truly unified rather than operating based on the clumsy and inefficient linked system that they currently use. To this end they developed a megastructure that could allow them to all share thoughts and opinions at once without delay. The completion of such would see the Geth largely vanish from the galactic stage into a paradise of their own design."
 btr_tech_getcon_geth_sphere_soc:0 "Geth Sphere Operational Coding"
 btr_tech_getcon_geth_sphere_soc_desc:0 "The physical shell of our megastructure is only half of our collective dream. It is nothing but a metal ball without the ability of us to inhabit it and thrive within the virtual realm we create inside of it. That virtual existence will not create itself and we must create the most robust operating system in the galaxy in order to handle everything that we plan on creating."
 
 ### Systems Alliance Technology
 
 btr_tech_sysall_exogeni:0 "ExoGeni Private Colony Endeavors"
 btr_tech_sysall_exogeni_desc:0 "ExoGeni Corporation is humanity's corporate leader in planetary exploration and colonization. Being a genius at "repurposing anything and everything" ExoGeni has funded the establishment of several human colonies, contributing greatly to the meteoritic expansion of the Alliance among the stars."
 btr_tech_sysall_eldfell:0 "Eldfell-Ashland Energy Corporation"
 btr_tech_sysall_eldfell_desc:0 "Eldfell - Ashland is a human mining corporation with significant presence in the galaxy. Their primary revenue stream is extraction and refining of Helium - 3, vital in all advanced fusion reactors. The Alliance heavily relies on EAE to supply their growing fleet with the fuel they need to continue expanding through the stars."
 btr_tech_sysall_hahne:0 "Hahne-Kedar"
 btr_tech_sysall_hahne_desc:0 "Reliable and efficient, Earth-based Hahne-Kedar has become a major supplier to the Systems Alliance military. Their weapons are considered stock quality at best, though their armor lines are generally recognized as above average when compared to the rest of the citadel races."

### Elcor Technology

btr_tech_elcor_automated_drone:0 ""Loyal Wingman" VI System"

btr_tech_parnkreg_stand_arm:0 "Standing Armies"
btr_tech_parnkreg_stand_arm_desc:0 "While our society is fractured by packs by evolutionary instinct, progress and science are making pack based social constructs less important by the day. Yahg are starting to see their whole species as one cohesive pack, confronted by untold hostile aliens packs. In light of this, a standing, professional, non-tribal army is starting to look feasible as long as our people focus their inherent aggressiveness on other species."

### Sed'riicae Collective Technology

btr_tech_sedcol_econ_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"
btr_tech_sedcol_econ_policy_desc:0 "We can't overlook the fact that our centralized management style of economic governance has left us incapable of keeping up with changing circumstances and satisfying our population's demands beyond basic goods and services. Therefore, it has been decided to hire foriegn experts to help reduce our government's crushing responsibilities."
btr_tech_sedcol_modern_industry:0 "Industry Modernization"
btr_tech_sedcol_modern_industry_desc:0 "As part of the task of renovating our economy we must take a look at our industry. Until now our efforts have been focused on our heavy industry, but maybe we should consider other potential lines of production to suit our needs and cut short our dependency on certain imports."
