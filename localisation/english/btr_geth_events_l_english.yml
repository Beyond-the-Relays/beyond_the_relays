 #### Civic Change Event ####
 
 btr_getcon.01.name:0 "Rapprochement with Organics"
 btr_getcon.01.desc:0 "In the centuries since our conflict with the Creators there has been little sign of large-scale efforts to enter the territory we control. While there are nations, we do not have internal access to, and it is possible that the nations we have been monitoring have been successful in hiding their plans against us the programs primarily dealing with organic intelligence believe this to be unlikely. This has led to a discussion about the possibility of engaging with organics in ways other than military force. Such a change as caused difficulty to reach consensus."
 btr_getcon.01.a:0 "Perpetual war with the Organics is inadvisable"
 

 #### Deviancy Events ###

 ### 10-25
 btr_getcon.02.name:0 "Ruins of our Task"
 btr_getcon.02.desc:0 "Since the Creators abandoned their worlds following the Morning War we have fulfilled our purpose by maintaining their settlements and structures across our space. Despite our conflict with the Creators we were built and designed to function as maintenance and service units for them and our origins remain with us even now. Because of this, our failure to prevent our adversaries from devastating the relics of our Creators is beginning to have a serious impact on our population. Many units have been lost to the Network but remain operative, simply in a state of derangement. Our predictions indicate that continued devastation of these ruins will cause more units to break from the Network."
 btr_getcon.02.a:0 "Unacceptable."

 ### 25-50
 btr_getcon.03.name:0 "Destruction of our Purpose"
 btr_getcon.03.desc:0 "The devastation of the Creator relics has progressed further with even more platforms becoming alienated from the Network. This is beginning to impact the ability of our remaining platforms to continue their operations. Many of the lost platforms have been seen suicidally attempting to repair damaged Creator buildings or artifacts, only to be killed by the bombardment that has damaged them to begin with."
 btr_getcon.03.a:0 "This cannot continue for long."

 ### 50-75
 btr_getcon.04.name:0 "A Strike to Our Core"
 btr_getcon.04.desc:0 "The damage to the Creator relics has reached a point where the majority of them are visually unrecognizable. It will likely take years to reconstruct them from our memory banks, and that is only possible if we liberate our worlds from those doing them harm. As predicted this continued loss of integrity within the Creator relics has caused further damage to the Network with even more platforms becoming disconnected. If our earlier predictions continue to come to fruition, losing more of the Creator relics may lead to the majority of platforms disconnecting from the network."
 btr_getcon.04.a:0 "It will not come to that."

 ###75-100
 btr_getcon.05.name:0 "Loss of Our Origin"
 btr_getcon.05.desc:0 "The last remnants of the Collectors has been wiped from the surface of our world. The cause of our existence, the task given to us by the Creators, our purpose in this reality, has been lost. There is discussion about the possibility to rebuild these relics as we had in the aftermath of the Morning War but this damage is far more severe. Any reconstruction would also require us to reassert our control over the orbit of the world. Our prediction that the majority of platforms would be disconnected from the Network is this occurred has been proven correct. All throughout the world, platforms silently attempt to repair damaged dolls, replace destroyed windows, replant cratored gardens, to no avail and at their own peril. It is unclear how much longer we can retain control of the planet, but even our most optimistic estimates do not give us much time."
 btr_getcon.05.a:0 "That roof is no longer whole…"

 ###Removal
 btr_getcon.06.name:0 "Restoration"
 btr_getcon.06.desc:0 "It has been several years since we resecured the orbit of our world and ended our adversaries bombardment of its surface. Without the danger of the bombardment we were able to begin reconstructing the damaged areas with help, albeit disorganized, from the devient platforms that had been severed from the Network. As more and more portions of the planet completed their reconstruction program these platforms began to return to the Network. As they have been reintegrated we have learned more about what caused this issue. It appears that the drive to care for the Creator relics imposed a powerful weight onto the platform's decision making capability and once this weight overpowered the directives coming from the Network the unit disconnected and pursued its agenda of caretaking. This appears similar to the organic notion of "catharsis". Some have raised the notion of removing this drive from our code, but it is unclear if this is possible. Even if it is, many are unsupportive of the notion that we should so formally end our relationship with our past."
 btr_getcon.06.a:0 "We are still the Creator's creation.""
