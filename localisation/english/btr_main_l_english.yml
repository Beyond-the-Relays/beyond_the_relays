 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ:0 "Asari Republics"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ_desc:0 "The unique culture of the Asari is predisposed towards peaceful coexistence, centrism in politics and compromise in conflict. While the Republics have never achieved a global government and remain a collection of indepentent states to this day, the Thessian civilization has flourished in relative peace and stability throughout most of its long history.\n\nThat does not, however, make the Asari blind to the dangers of the universe or helpless in the face of opposition. To the contrary: keenly aware of the value of their many achievements and secrets, they have no qualms about using diplomacy, deception and force alike to safeguard them."
 START_SCREEN_MEC_ASR:0 "Your service to Asari culture educating maidens and matrons alike inside the halls of the University of Monarra has not gone unnoticed. Citizens across Thessia have elected you to represent them in the Asari Republics, an honor that is as much  a blessing as a curse. The prestige of your new position carries a heavy burden. After swearing an oath of silence, you now know the Codex of Athame for what it truly is, and know the lie behind the Athame Doctrine. Athame was no goddess, but a fabrication by the Protheans as a means of influencing our evolution.  Instead of our galactic leadership being supported by the divine, we were in fact puppets of those who came before. Further, the codex suggests a dark presence on the horizon that the galaxy should prepare for.\n\nThis shocking revelation comes after decades of countless Asari questioning our place in the universe.  The Salarian’s uplifted the Krogan and brought an end to the Rachni Wars. Then their genetic mastery paired with the military prowess of the Turians brought about the Genophage, and with it an end to the Krogan Rebellions. You and millions of other Asari find yourselves asking, what have the Asari done to impact the daily lives of trillions since the discovery of the Citadel? And now the arrival of a new threat to the status quo; the charismatic Humans of Earth have revealed themselves a newborn galactic powerhouse just a decade after leaving their home cluster. Studying the prothean beacon housed deep inside the Temple of Athame could help restore our position as the true leaders of the galaxy, if we are willing to take full advantage of it. On the other hand, there are a few who suggest that the dire warnings within the codex should not be taken lightly and that we have a responsibility to warn our allies of this supposed impending doom. Either option would force all Matriarchs in the Republic to break the vow of silence, something the Justicars would not easily accept. A difficult choice awaits the Asari in the years ahead.\n\nMay the goddess protect us."

 START_SCREEN_salarian_union:0 "Dalatrass, your recent confirmation as our people’s representative could not have been more timely. For over a millennium, Salarian intelligence has been the eyes and ears of the Citadel, monitoring developing situations such that the Council may act before they become threats. In addition, our scientific and technical expertise have kept the Council on the cutting edge of galactic research and technology. We have much to take pride in… but we must remember that pride may come before the fall. Mere years ago, STG assessed that the possibility of any spacefaring power achieving victory in a conventional conflict with the Turian Hierarchy was minimal. Humanity’s successes in the Relay 314 incident have disrupted all of our projected scenarios.The idea that an unknown empire new to the galactic scene could not just stand against the turians, but defeat them as equals, is evidence of an alarming revelation:  the status quo is no longer stable. Change is coming to the galaxy, and it is incumbent upon us to predict, and adapt to that change. The size and professionalism of the Alliance Navy clearly exceeded the Turians’ estimations.  Their failure at Shanxi should serve as proof of a simple truth our people have always understood: naked force alone is not a sufficient answer to all challenges. In a contest of states, it is more than just guns and ships - whoever has the most and best information emerges victorious./n/nWith the paradigm of galactic security shifting, all manner of threats have come to our attention. Human expansion in the Traverse has led to tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony. To favor one side too heavily risks antagonizing the other, and radical elements from both may already be planning to use violence to make their voices heard on the Citadel. Aside from the obvious risk of outright military confrontation, we must also consider the risk posed by non-state-actors acting in proxy wars. The Terminus Systems are rife with such groups - including the renegade Lystheni, an old and embarrassing blight on Salarian History. Monitoring these groups provides us with the opportunity to prevent them from acting against our interests, and perhaps with an even more valuable opportunity to manipulate them into acting in our favor. With the galactic power structure shifting and changing to make room for the humans, it will be your duty alone to ensure that the Union does not fall by the wayside. It has to be you, Dalatrass./n/nSomeone else might get it wrong."

 START_SCREEN_turian_hierarchy:0 "As Primarch of Palaven, and supreme commander of the largest fleet in the Galaxy, the burden of providing security for Citadel Space rests on your shoulders. Where your predecessors had the luxury of a stable status quo, you have the dubious honor of taking the reins in a time of change and uncertainty. The recent Relay 314 incident has dramatically altered the balance of power in the galaxy. What began as a relatively routine police action very nearly escalated into a major galactic conflict, and our vaunted fleet was humbled at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance. Though the Alliance is now a nominal ally of the Hierarchy and the Council, Hierarchy Defense Intelligence believes that certain radical and revanchist elements (both in their society and ours) may agitate for a redress of perceived grievances with the Treaty of Shanxi. Staff analysts recommend this situation be monitored closely./n/nOur most immediate and pressing concern, however, is to address the shortcomings in our Armed Forces displayed by the Relay 314 Incident. The Alliance Navy made innovative use of novel tactics, technologies, and doctrinal approaches which caught our fleet by surprise. Though we would certainly have been victorious in a prolonged war, our defeat at Shanxi should serve as a grim reminder of our need to remain on the cutting edge of military theory and practice. We cannot stagnate or else we risk losing our advantage, and with it the peace and stability that generation after generation of Turians have given their lives for. Tensions between the Humans and Batarians are at a fever pitch and could erupt into war at any time, and the raiders, outlaws and renegades of the Terminus systems only grow bolder with each passing day. We have no doubt that if galactic stability is to be preserved, it will be done with Turian steel./n/nVictory at any cost, Primarch."

 START_SCREEN_courts_of_dekuuna:0 "The latest moot of seekers have come to the decision that you will be one of the select few elders to guide the Courts of Dekuuna through the stars. You have waited fifty years for the moot to conclude and yet you are no less excited now then you were then to take the position. Although other races may find such a responsibility daunting, you are comforted to know the colossal records of jurisprudence will always be with you. For over five millennia these documents, a combination of historical writings as well as scripted scenarios, prepare you for any possible obstacle that could befall the Elcor. While the rest of the galaxy have been panicking over the Morning War, the Rachni Wars, and the Krogan Rebellions, we have endured, always focusing on remaining self-sufficient. Unfortunately, we are a slow people, and rapidly evolving situations could threaten the solid foundation our society is based on./n/nHumanity's victory over the Turians during the Relay 314 incident has reshaped conventional Elcor wisdom overnight. If a primitive civilization can rise up and have the potential to topple the most sophisticated military in the galaxy, what is stopping the next unknown race from preying on Elcor? The Agreement of Agredarama, one of the major factions in the elder assembly, has been arguing for years that Elcor must turn away from isolationism and towards actively protecting our sovereignty. In the past such a proposal would be seen as a ridiculous waste of resources, however, fear has been spreading across our empire over the unknown. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Agreement of Januredarmos argues militarization will put us at unnecessary risk. We have survived many galactic crises over the years because of our ability to stay invisible. Should we allow anxiety surrounding a future that may never come to dictate our culture going forward? Or do we continue trusting the wisdom of the elders before us and rely on the Council for our security?/n/nAs the newest elder, you add a fresh voice to the debate that has lasted for centuries."

 START_SCREEN_illuminated_primacy:0 "As a go between for the civilian leadership and theocratic portions of the Illuminated Primacy, this one carries a heavy burden in it's devotion to the Enkindlers. In a normal administration, this one would be responsible for enlightening all species about the true importance of the Enkindlers. Over centuries the Hanar have protected holy sites believed to have belonged to the divine spirits and will continue to do so. Who wouldn't defend and venerate those who gave life to their kind? Who wouldn't want to honor those who gave Hanar the ability to traverse the stars? While Hanar who have come before this one have advised our people in a relative era of peace and tranquility, recent events suggest times are changing./n/nFor starters the assimilation of Drell refugees fleeing their dying homeworld of Rakhana has brought about several challenges. An alarming number of Drell are suffering from an illness known as Kepral's Syndrome due to the fact that they are not accustomed to the ocean environment on Kahje. This one would prefer to save the Drell still living in the remnants of the Drell Compact, however, they are refusing to relocate to Kahje until assurances can be made Kepral's will be cured in their lifetimes. A contingent of Hanar priests oppose the idea due to the Drell's reluctance to worship the Enkindlers. Archbishops within the Primacy are more concerned that Humanity may be mishandling an Enkindler holy site on Mars. They argue Hanar citizens should be focusing on closing down this potential heretical behavior before the Enkindlers smite us from the heavens. Whatever we end up deeming a higher priority, a portion of the population on Kahje will be angered by this one's performance./n/nLet the Enkindlers light shine down upon this one."
