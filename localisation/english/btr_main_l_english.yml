 NAME_Asari_Republics:0 "§MAsari Republics"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ:0 "§MAsari Republics"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe Asari, a mono-gender race that are distinctly feminine in appearance and pose maternal instincts. The asari resemble human females in terms of basic skeletal structure with five digits on each hand and feet that are relatively straight. A typical asari commonly has a blue to purple complexion through a teal complexion is seemingly rare. Originally arose from the planet Thessia, a rich planet with abundant quantities of element zero that caused much of life on Thessia to exhibit biotic tendencies. Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a \"long view\" not common in other races. When they encounter a new species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nTraditionally, asari spread their influence through cultural domination and intellectual superiority. The pantheistic mainstream asari religion is siari, which translates roughly as \"All is one\". The faithful agree on certain core truths: the universe is a consciousness, every life within it is an aspect of the greater whole, and death is a merging of one's spiritual energy back into greater universal consciousness. The asari governmental structure, known as the Asari Republics, is relatively broad; the asari came late to the notion of world government. All aspects of policy are open to plebiscite at any time. In any given debate, the asari tend to lend the most credence to the opinions of any Matriarchs present, nearly always deferring to the experience of these millennia-old \"wise women\".\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe asari military resembles a collection of tribal warrior bands with no national structure. Each community organizes its own unit as the locals see fit and elect a leader to command them Units from populous cities are large and well-equipped, while those from farm villages may be only a few women with small arms. There is no uniform; everyone wears what they like. The asari military is not an irregular militia, however; those who serve are full-time professionals. The asari possess the largest single economy in the galaxy. They have extensive trade and social contacts. Craft guilds, such as those within the cities Serrice and Armali, hold a virtual monopoly on advanced Biotic Technology."
 START_SCREEN_MEC_ASR:0 "Your service to Asari culture educating maidens and matrons alike inside the halls of the University of Monarra has not gone unnoticed. Citizens across Thessia have elected you to represent them in the Asari Republics, an honor that is as much  a blessing as a curse. The prestige of your new position carries a heavy burden. After swearing an oath of silence, you now know the Codex of Athame for what it truly is, and know the lie behind the Athame Doctrine. Athame was no goddess, but a fabrication by the Protheans as a means of influencing our evolution.  Instead of our galactic leadership being supported by the divine, we were in fact puppets of those who came before. Further, the codex suggests a dark presence on the horizon that the galaxy should prepare for. \n\nThis shocking revelation comes after decades of countless Asari questioning our place in the universe.  The Salarian’s uplifted the Krogan and brought an end to the Rachni Wars. Then their genetic mastery paired with the military prowess of the Turians brought about the Genophage, and with it an end to the Krogan Rebellions. You and millions of other Asari find yourselves asking, what have the Asari done to impact the daily lives of trillions since the discovery of the Citadel? And now the arrival of a new threat to the status quo; the charismatic Humans of Earth have revealed themselves a newborn galactic powerhouse just a decade after leaving their home cluster. Studying the prothean beacon housed deep inside the Temple of Athame could help restore our position as the true leaders of the galaxy, if we are willing to take full advantage of it. On the other hand, there are a few who suggest that the dire warnings within the codex should not be taken lightly and that we have a responsibility to warn our allies of this supposed impending doom. Either option would force all Matriarchs in the Republic to break the vow of silence, something the Justicars would not easily accept. A difficult choice awaits the Asari in the years ahead. \n\nMay the goddess protect us."

Most of them believe, and they would have the galaxy believe, that their early rise to interstellar power is owed to the ingenuity of their people and the utopian perfection of their society. \n\nHowever, a chosen few are privy to the dark truth behind their ascension - a precursor artifact they know as the Prothean Beacon contains vast stores of scientific knowledge within its databanks. Tapping into the archives of the fallen empire has allowed the Asari to achieve greatness, but for how much longer can they depend on it? Will there someday be a price to pay for the complacency they have allowed themselves to fall into?"

 NAME_Salarian_Union:0 "§MSalarian Union"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_salarian_union:0 "§MSalarian Union"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_salarian_union_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe salarians are warm-blooded amphibians native to the planet Sur’Kesh. Salarians possess a hyperactive metabolism; they think fast, talk fast, and move fast. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short lifespan; salarians over the age of 40 are a rarity. Salarians are known for their observational capability and non-linear thinking. This manifests as an aptitude for research and espionage. They are constantly experimenting and inventing, and it is generally accepted that they always know more than they are letting on.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nWhile modern Salarians are not notably religious, in ancient times some salarians practiced a religion that featured the so-called \"stones of life\". The salarians see information gathering and even spying as a matter of course when dealing with other races, but to them this is not underhanded: they simply embrace the dictum of \"knowledge is power\". The Salarian government, since at least the formation of the Council in 500 BCE, is called the Salarian Union. It is a labyrinthine web of matrilineal bloodlines, with political alliances formed through interbreeding. Structurally, the government consists of fiefdoms, baronies, duchies, planets, and marches (colonization clusters).\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe salarian economy is the smallest of the three Council races, but still far larger than the Alliance. It is based on \"bleeding-edge\" technologies; salarian industries are leaders in most fields. They make up for a lack of military quantity by holding a decisive superiority in quality. In principle, the salarian military consists of a small volunteer army that focuses on maneuver warfare. What differentiates the salarians is not their equipment or doctrine, but their intelligence services and rules of engagement. The salarians believe that a war should be won before it begins, the unquestioned superiority of their intelligence services allows them to use their small military to maximum effectiveness."
 START_SCREEN_salarian_union:0 "Dalatrass, your recent confirmation as our people’s representative could not have been more timely. For over a millennium, Salarian intelligence has been the eyes and ears of the Citadel, monitoring developing situations such that the Council may act before they become threats. In addition, our scientific and technical expertise have kept the Council on the cutting edge of galactic research and technology. We have much to take pride in… but we must remember that pride may come before the fall. Mere years ago, STG assessed that the possibility of any spacefaring power achieving victory in a conventional conflict with the Turian Hierarchy was minimal. Humanity’s successes in the Relay 314 incident have disrupted all of our projected scenarios.The idea that an unknown empire new to the galactic scene could not just stand against the turians, but defeat them as equals, is evidence of an alarming revelation:  the status quo is no longer stable. Change is coming to the galaxy, and it is incumbent upon us to predict, and adapt to that change. The size and professionalism of the Alliance Navy clearly exceeded the Turians’ estimations.  Their failure at Shanxi should serve as proof of a simple truth our people have always understood: naked force alone is not a sufficient answer to all challenges. In a contest of states, it is more than just guns and ships - whoever has the most and best information emerges victorious. \n\nWith the paradigm of galactic security shifting, all manner of threats have come to our attention. Human expansion in the Traverse has led to tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony. To favor one side too heavily risks antagonizing the other, and radical elements from both may already be planning to use violence to make their voices heard on the Citadel. Aside from the obvious risk of outright military confrontation, we must also consider the risk posed by non-state-actors acting in proxy wars. The Terminus Systems are rife with such groups - including the renegade Lystheni, an old and embarrassing blight on Salarian History. Monitoring these groups provides us with the opportunity to prevent them from acting against our interests, and perhaps with an even more valuable opportunity to manipulate them into acting in our favor. With the galactic power structure shifting and changing to make room for the humans, it will be your duty alone to ensure that the Union does not fall by the wayside. It has to be you, Dalatrass. \n\nSomeone else might get it wrong."

 NAME_Turian_Hierarchy:0 "§MTurian Hierarchy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_turian_hierarchy:0 "§MTurian Hierarchy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_turian_hierarchy_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe Turians typically stand over six feet tall (1.8m), have two long, proportionately thick fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand, each tipped with talons, and a set of mandibles around their mouths.  The most distinguishing feature of turians is their metallic carapace, which contains trace amounts of thulium. Turian civilization spans fifteen thousand years of history. Before the dawn of their civilization, the race was known to older space faring species like the Protheans, who viewed them as primitive as the other ruling races of the modern era.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nTurians are noted for their strong sense of public service. It is rare to find one who puts his needs ahead of the group. Every citizen from age 15 to 30 serves the state in some capacity, as anything from a soldier to an administrator, from a construction engineer to a sanitation worker. The Turian government, known as the Turian Hierarchy, is a hierarchical meritocracy. While it has great potential for misuse, this is tempered by the civic duty and personal responsibility turians learn during their childhood. Turians enjoy broad freedoms. So long as one completes their duties, and does not prevent others from completing theirs, nothing is forbidden.\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe turian economy is vastly larger than that of the Alliance but cannot match the size and power of that of the asari. For many years, development was hampered by cultural disinterest in economics. The military is supported by a well-developed infrastructure. Manufacturers such as Armax Arsenal and the Haliat Armoury produce advanced, reliable equipment. Enlisted personnel are thoroughly trained and stay calm under fire. Turian units don't break. Even if their entire line collapses, they fall back in order, setting ambushes as they go. A popular saying holds: \"You will only see a turian's back once he's dead.\". Boot camp begins on the 15th birthday. Soldiers receive a year of training before being assigned to a field unit, officers train for even longer. Most serve until the age of 30, at which they become part of the Reserves. Even if they suffer injuries preventing front-line service, most do support work behind the lines."
 START_SCREEN_turian_hierarchy:0 "As Primarch of Palaven, and supreme commander of the largest fleet in the Galaxy, the burden of providing security for Citadel Space rests on your shoulders. Where your predecessors had the luxury of a stable status quo, you have the dubious honor of taking the reins in a time of change and uncertainty. The recent Relay 314 incident has dramatically altered the balance of power in the galaxy. What began as a relatively routine police action very nearly escalated into a major galactic conflict, and our vaunted fleet was humbled at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance. Though the Alliance is now a nominal ally of the Hierarchy and the Council, Hierarchy Defense Intelligence believes that certain radical and revanchist elements (both in their society and ours) may agitate for a redress of perceived grievances with the Treaty of Shanxi. Staff analysts recommend this situation be monitored closely. \n\nOur most immediate and pressing concern, however, is to address the shortcomings in our Armed Forces displayed by the Relay 314 Incident. The Alliance Navy made innovative use of novel tactics, technologies, and doctrinal approaches which caught our fleet by surprise. Though we would certainly have been victorious in a prolonged war, our defeat at Shanxi should serve as a grim reminder of our need to remain on the cutting edge of military theory and practice. We cannot stagnate or else we risk losing our advantage, and with it the peace and stability that generation after generation of Turians have given their lives for. Tensions between the Humans and Batarians are at a fever pitch and could erupt into war at any time, and the raiders, outlaws and renegades of the Terminus systems only grow bolder with each passing day. We have no doubt that if galactic stability is to be preserved, it will be done with Turian steel. \n\nVictory at any cost, Primarch."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_courts_of_dekuuna_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nElcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature and immense strength, as well as thick, tough skin. Prehistoric elcor travelled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. These groups were likely led by the oldest and most experienced elcor. This may have later developed into the elcor culture of Elders, whose wisdom could keep the tribe safe provided they followed the correct guidance.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nLike other sapient races, elcor are no strangers to entertainment and the arts. Artists like Forta are reputed to have made works that can make viewers go mad if stared at for too long. Elcor are traditionally migratory in nature. This reflects on their choice of twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season. The Elcor government is known as the Courts of Dekuuna. The elcor follow the recommendations of their Elders, who spend years poring over ancient records of jurisprudence to determine the precedent that should be followed in any given situation. The Elders record closely argued and minutely detailed instructions on what course to follow in any theoretical crisis. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nBecause of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. The Elcor does not maintain a large fleet of military starships. This seems to be due to a combination of their conservative nature preventing hasty rushes to war, and their relatively isolated and self-sufficient economy that would never encounter a trade dispute serious enough to threaten war over. The Elcor economy is small, only slightly larger than the Alliance’s, but extremely well developed. They see no point to rushing things, and are fond of making thorough, century-long development plans."
 START_SCREEN_courts_of_dekuuna:0 "The latest moot of seekers have come to the decision that you will be one of the select few elders to guide the Courts of Dekuuna through the stars. You have waited fifty years for the moot to conclude and yet you are no less excited now then you were then to take the position. Although other races may find such a responsibility daunting, you are comforted to know the colossal records of jurisprudence will always be with you. For over five millennia these documents, a combination of historical writings as well as scripted scenarios, prepare you for any possible obstacle that could befall the Elcor. While the rest of the galaxy have been panicking over the Morning War, the Rachni Wars, and the Krogan Rebellions, we have endured, always focusing on remaining self-sufficient. Unfortunately, we are a slow people, and rapidly evolving situations could threaten the solid foundation our society is based on. \n\nHumanity's victory over the Turians during the Relay 314 incident has reshaped conventional Elcor wisdom overnight. If a primitive civilization can rise up and have the potential to topple the most sophisticated military in the galaxy, what is stopping the next unknown race from preying on Elcor? The Agreement of Agredarama, one of the major factions in the elder assembly, has been arguing for years that Elcor must turn away from isolationism and towards actively protecting our sovereignty. In the past such a proposal would be seen as a ridiculous waste of resources, however, fear has been spreading across our empire over the unknown. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Agreement of Januredarmos argues militarization will put us at unnecessary risk. We have survived many galactic crises over the years because of our ability to stay invisible. Should we allow anxiety surrounding a future that may never come to dictate our culture going forward? Or do we continue trusting the wisdom of the elders before us and rely on the Council for our security?\n\nAs the newest elder, you add a fresh voice to the debate that has lasted for centuries."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_illuminated_primacy_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nHanar are biologically genderless, though others may assign arbitrary gender values to them for convenience. Despite evolving in water, hanar also appear able to breathe air, or use technological means to enable this. The invertebrate, water-native hanar cannot support their own weight in normal gravity. When interacting with mainstream galactic society, they rely on contra-gravity levitation packs that use mass effect fields. Their limbs can grip tightly but are not strong enough to lift more than a few hundred grams each.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThe hanar homeworld, kahje has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of clouds. Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient species, calling them the \"Enkindlers\". Hanar myths often speak of them as an elder race that uplifted and civilized them by teaching them language. The Hanar government is known as the Illuminated Primacy. The hanar are considered likely prospects for a Council seat soon, though what great deed the hanar did for the Council to warrant consideration is not revealed.\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe hanar navy is relatively small but is supplemented by drell combat specialists: accomplished spies, saboteurs, and assassins trained from a young age. Kahje is protected by an automated planetary defence system. While the system is effective against most attackers, it is vulnerable to internal sabotage, as only moderate government clearance is necessary to access it and a single computer virus can quickly compromise the entire network.  Economic contacts are limited to a handful of trade stations on their borders. Due to this self-imposed isolation and the unique physiology of the race, their economy is small and isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Few standard technologies (designed for bipedal and fingered species) are available in their space, and they produce very few goods that are usable by others."
 START_SCREEN_illuminated_primacy:0 "As a go between for the civilian leadership and theocratic portions of the Illuminated Primacy, this one carries a heavy burden in it's devotion to the Enkindlers. In a normal administration, this one would be responsible for enlightening all species about the true importance of the Enkindlers. Over centuries the Hanar have protected holy sites believed to have belonged to the divine spirits and will continue to do so. Who wouldn't defend and venerate those who gave life to their kind? Who wouldn't want to honor those who gave Hanar the ability to traverse the stars? While Hanar who have come before this one have advised our people in a relative era of peace and tranquility, recent events suggest times are changing. \n\nFor starters the assimilation of Drell refugees fleeing their dying homeworld of Rakhana has brought about several challenges. An alarming number of Drell are suffering from an illness known as Kepral's Syndrome due to the fact that they are not accustomed to the ocean environment on Kahje. This one would prefer to save the Drell still living in the remnants of the Drell Compact, however, they are refusing to relocate to Kahje until assurances can be made Kepral's will be cured in their lifetimes. A contingent of Hanar priests oppose the idea due to the Drell's reluctance to worship the Enkindlers. Archbishops within the Primacy are more concerned that Humanity may be mishandling an Enkindler holy site on Mars. They argue Hanar citizens should be focusing on closing down this potential heretical behavior before the Enkindlers smite us from the heavens. Whatever we end up deeming a higher priority, a portion of the population on Kahje will be angered by this one's performance. \n\nLet the Enkindlers light shine down upon this one."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_systems_alliance_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nHumans have a robust physiology. Their internal makeup and reproductive processes are typical of most bipedal mammals, and their size and proportions give the appearance of being strong, fast, and agile.  Humans can live to about 150 years, and recent medical advances have eradicated almost all known diseases that afflict them. Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. \n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nHumans are generally seen to be very intelligent, abnormally ambitious, highly adaptable, individualistic, and thus, unpredictable. They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the normally staid Council races have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity. Religion was, and to an extent, still is a major part of human culture, even though society is largely secular by the 22nd century. The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of humanity, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer their own territories. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe Alliance has quickly become a key player in the galactic economy, with several large human corporations taking their market share. The Alliance economy, though growing, does not yet come close to that of the Asari. and is only approaching that of the Elcor. The Alliance and the Turian Hierarchy have become large trade partners despite lingering animosity over the First Contact War. The Alliance military is respected by the Citadel races for its novel tactics and technology. Their strength lies in fire support, flexibility, and speed. The Council regards the Alliance as a \"sleeping giant\" as only 3% of humans volunteer for military service. On defense, the Alliance military lives by Sun Tzu's maxim, \"He who tries to defend everything defends nothing.\" Only token garrisons are placed on their colonies. These are intended for scouting rather than combat, avoiding engagement to observe and report on invaders using drones. However, the Alliance stations powerful fleets at mass relay nexuses so that in the event of an attack they respond with overwhelming force."
 START_SCREEN_systems_alliance:0 "Having just been elected to the position of  Prime Minister on Earth, it is important you understand the past few years have been a humbling experience for the Human race. Although we had once considered ourselves the apex predator in the galaxy, the events of the First Contact War have taught us otherwise. The galaxy is full of a diverse plethora of aliens and their agendas need to be monitored. Intelligence services have been tracking a growing number of Humans who believe our concessions to the Citadel Council after the war with the Turians were too steep and drastic action must be taken to remedy the situation. Even though accepting the Treaty of Shanxi has limited our possible expansion and militarization,  joining the Council and lifting restrictions from within will be much safer than losing millions of lives in another war with the Turians. It remains to be seen what lengths these Humans will go to voice their demands but, it has not been deemed an immediate risk by your advisors. \n\nOne issue for  your immediate attention is the rising galactic security threat of the Batarian Hegemony. The Batarians, positioned to our galactic south, have the misguided belief that the Citadel Council has given us special treatment in terms of colonization rights across the Traverse. While the Batarians lackluster living conditions are a consequence of their own backwards culture, we will have to deal with their perceived suffering. Some military officers have suggested bolstering our presence along the border systems to defend Human colonies. A fleet buildup may signal to our radical elements that we are interested in retribution rather than containing the Batarian threat. Political groups within parliament have instead pushed for fostering closer relations with the Batarians. Lifting our empires together may show the Council we deserve a spot in their ranks. \n\nRegardless of your decision, we shall overcome and rise to galactic prominence."

This is reflected in the physiology of the volus themselves. The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, and as such require protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere, as well as being pressurized to support the volus. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low-pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will split open.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nVolus culture is dominated by trade, whether it be of land, resources, or even other tribe members. Due to the volus not being physically adept, they tend not to be violent, and can even seem overly pacifistic and cowardly to other, more militant species. The volus hold in high regard an artifact called the Book of Plenix, which calls for charity and forgiveness of debts in case the volus do become involved in war. The volus government is known as the Vol Protectorate. Rather than being a fully sovereign government, the Protectorate is a client state of the Turian Hierarchy. In return for falling under the protective umbrella of the turian military, the volus pay a tax to the Hierarchy, as well as deferring to the turians in all foreign policy matters and providing auxiliary troops to the turian armed forces. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe volus are not physically cut out for combat, be it a full-scale war or even a bar room scuffle. As such, they are highly dependent on the turians for defence, although the volus themselves do provide some auxiliary troops to the Hierarchy. These forces rely on specially sealed Armor in combat and mitigate their disadvantages using technologically advanced power Armor as well as avant-garde equipment. The volus will support the turians in any war they might pursue, and the turians will do the same for the volus. The volus economy is out of proportion to their modest resource base. They are aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the Elkoss Combine are owned, or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy."
 START_SCREEN_vol_protectorate:0 "Congratulations on your success in the succession negotiations, High Chief. The Tribal Assembly looks forward to seeing you lead our people to further prosperity, even in these uncertain times. Change is coming to the galaxy - the defeat of our Suzerain, the Turian Hierarchy, at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance is proof enough of that.Unpredictable situations are not, however, necessarily unwelcome. Though their economy is young and still growing, Humanity’s determination to expand into the Traverse provides us with a wealth of opportunities. The region is rich in resources, and if the Humans were able to bring the riches of the Traverse to market, the benefits for all Citadel species - including our own - would be incalculable. Though our Turian protectors remain wary of Humanity, it would behoove us to see them as another opportunity to be invested in. Lingering resentment on both sides of the Relay 314 Incident provides us with a unique opportunity to serve as an honest broker between the Humans and the Turians - and Council space as a whole. \n\nSuch an endeavour would not be without risks, however. Humanity’s expansion has as much potential to become threatening as it does beneficial. Already the Batarians are upset about perceived Human encroachments on their territory, and the myriad criminal enterprises of the Terminus Systems may prove to be too much for the Humans to handle. War and instability in the Attican Traverse would create market conditions ill suited to expansion. Even more frustrating is that our direct competitors, the conglomerate of Asari Corporate Interests based out of Illium, seem to have no problem doing business in the Terminus Systems. Our suzerains may not be pleased, but if we are to remain competitive, it may be necessary for us to pursue trade relationships with the various petty states of the Terminus.The Book of Plenix teaches us to be prudent, to be frugal, and most of all to be vigilant in times such as these. \n\nMay its wisdom flow through you, High Chief."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_batarian_hegemony_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nBatarians are an anthropoidal race like Humans and Asari. Their faces are covered with short, fine hairs that grow longer and thicker around the mouth. A flat stripe of ridged cartilage runs along the tops of their skulls and down the backs of their necks. They have ears pointy at the upper end, though on occasion along the edges as well. Their most distinctive physical feature is their four eyes, an uncommon trait among other races. One pair is set wide in prominent bony sockets protruding from the corners of their face. The second set of eyes is smaller and closer together, set higher on the face, just beneath the middle of the forehead. When the batarians achieved spaceflight, they discovered concealed Prothean ruins on Bira, a moon of Verush, that allowed them to develop Faster Than Light travel. It is a batarian point of pride that, since the ruins were damaged by earthquakes, they had less information to go on than other space faring races. \n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nBatarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other races find it difficult to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them. The rest of the galaxy views the batarians as an ignorable problem. Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is still hostile to the Systems Alliance, but beneath the notice of the powerful Council races. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nLittle is known about the batarian military. Citadel sanctions have left the Batarian Hegemony a paper tiger of an empire, one that fights rivals through deniable terrorist actions rather than the wars of its heyday centuries ago. The Batarian Hegemony does not trust private industry to create their military hardware. Most batarian military hardware is produced by a corporation called Batarian state arms, a vast nationalized institution infamous for its waste and corruption. The batarian military has a special forces division known as the Special Intervention Unit. All that is known about the SIU is that their training program is brutal. Other known branches of the batarian military include the Batarian External Forces."
 START_SCREEN_batarian_hegemony:0 "Hegemon, your ascension to power comes at a critical moment in the history of our people. For generations we Batarians felt secure in our assumption that we were the masters of the Attican Traverse, establishing outposts and colonies at our leisure. Thanks to the arrival of the Humans to the region, we now risk being cut off from the Traverse entirely. The Systems Alliance seems to claim new worlds by the day, worlds that rightfully should have been ours. As their colonial holdings expand, so too does the reach of their fleet. The Alliance Navy are a force to be reckoned with, as their recent successes against the Turians have shown. Our security services also believe the Alliance poses a risk to our internal stability. It is possible that the Alliance may seek to subvert our caste system by driving a wedge between the servile caste and the rest of Batarian society. \n\nThe future of the Hegemony will depend on how we manage this threat. We could petition the Citadel Council to curb human expansion, but it is no secret that the Council holds our caste based society in contempt. We must be prepared for them to side with the upstart humans in this dispute. A growing faction of Batarian officials have even suggested that our affiliation with the Council may no longer serve our national interests. Regardless of how we choose to handle the humans, we must redouble our colonization efforts in the Traverse if we are to credibly contest Alliance expansion. Countering aggression with aggression is one option, though it risks instigating a war that we may not be able to win without significant preparation. It may be possible to work through the council and establish an equitable arrangement for colony rights in the Traverse, but given the Council's antipathy towards us, this may be just as dangerous to our territorial ambitions as a war would be. A few advisors have come up with the radical idea of sabotaging humanity without directly engaging their military. If credits, equipment, and deniable special forces advisors were funneled into certain reliable mercenary and criminal organizations, human colonies in the Traverse could quickly become a very dangerous proposition. Your decisions in the days to come will be critical. Our people will either rise to their rightful place as one of the Great Powers of the galaxy, or be relegated to the dustbin of history. \n\nMay the Pillars of Strength guide you to greatness, Hegemon."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_cerberus_desc:0 "Cerberus is a human-survivalist paramilitary group led by the enigmatic Illusive Man. Cerberus' core belief is that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community, and that the Systems Alliance is too hamstrung by law and public opinion to stand up effectively to the other Citadel races. Cerberus supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal or dangerous experimentation, terrorist activities, sabotage, and assassination. Cerberus operatives accept that these methods are brutal but believe history will vindicate them. Nevertheless, both the Systems Alliance and the Citadel Council have declared Cerberus to be a terrorist organization and will prosecute identified Cerberus agents accordingly. Cerberus has wealthy sympathizers within the Alliance military-industrial complex, who contribute credits and resources to Cerberus, and trust the Illusive Man to make the right decisions. Cerberus also owns several front corporations which further fund and support their operations. Spending trends indicate that Cerberus has a reliable income running up to several billion credits per year. Cerberus is divided into numerous independent cells which have no knowledge of their counterparts. This ensures that should one cell be compromised; the others would not be captured. Each cell is led by an operative who reports directly to the Illusive Man. Cerberus operates many kinds of cells, ranging from military to political to scientific, but all united under the common goal of advancing humanity. Cerberus also has operatives throughout the Alliance, often embedded in high-ranking positions, giving the Illusive Man constant updates, and feeding him information that would otherwise be classified. Communication throughout Cerberus sometimes takes the form of steganographic messages embedded within extranet broadcasts. These messages can range from troop movement orders to instructions to financiers to direct money into certain cells. This method of communication was recently compromised by the Systems Alliance."

Since then, the drell have remained loyal to the hanar for their camaraderie and have fit comfortably into galactic civilization. Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with an average lifespan of 85 galactic standard years. Drell appearance is very similar to Asari and Humans, but their muscle tissue is slightly denser, giving them a wiry strength. They appear to have five fingers on each hand, albeit the ring and middle fingers are fused. Their skin is apparently infused with a venom mild enough to be served in drinks and may cause mild hallucinations on \"oral contact\". They also have two sets of eyelids, akin to the Nictitating membrane possessed by certain animals such as reptiles. The inner lid is milky-white and closes from the left and right, while the outer lid is black and closes from top and bottom. Much like humans or asari, drell possesses the ability to shed tears. The drell possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource (vegetation, drinkable water, and prey migration paths) across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall. These recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality.\n\nThe debt of gratitude that the drell owes the hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the drell fulfils by taking on tasks that the hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve is a great honour, few turn down the offer. Most drell are content to live on Kahje. They are afforded every opportunity to thrive by the hanar, yet some outsiders and even some hanar regard the drell as second-class citizens. However, it is quite the opposite, they have integrated themselves into every level of hanar society as respected, productive citizens. Those who leave Kahje tend to be adventurers. These solitary drell travelers often seek out new species elsewhere, and in turn adopt that species' culture. Such drell number in the thousands, and are scattered across the galaxy, tending towards quiet, integrated lives.\n\nMost drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death as a departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_krogan_chiefdom:0 "§HKrogan Chiefdom"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_krogan_chiefdom_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe krogan are a species of large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh environments, scarce resources, and overabundance of vicious predators. The krogan managed to not only survive on their unforgiving homeworld but thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war that reduced their race into primitive warring tribes. Due to the brutality of their surroundings, natural selection has played a significant role in the evolution of the krogan. Krogan eyes have narrow pupils. Their irises may be red, green, amber, or blue in color. Their large shoulder humps store fluids and nutrients, enabling them to survive extended periods without food or water. They require very little water intake; a 55-gallon tank system can sustain an entire colony of krogan for over 10 years. A bigger shoulder hump is seen as a sign of high status, showing how successful an individual krogan is at hunting. Ancient Krogen society was once rich with cultural, architectural, and artistic accomplishments. However, the krogan birth rate exploded despite the natural limits of their predatory homeworld once they achieved industrialization. Technology made life \"too easy\" for them, so when they looked for new challenges, they found those in each other. Wars were fought over dwindling resources as the krogan expanded. Four thousand years ago, at the dawn of the krogan nuclear age, battles to claim the small pockets of territory capable of sustaining life escalated into full scale global war. Weapons of mass destruction were unleashed, transforming Tuchanka into a radioactive wasteland. The krogan were reduced to primitive warring clans struggling to survive a nuclear winter of their own creation, a state that continued until they were discovered by the Salarians two thousand years later.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThe harsh krogan homeworld conditioned the krogan psychology for toughness just as it did the body. Krogan have always tended to be selfish, unsympathetic, and blunt. Sometimes, when krogan disagree, one of them will head-butt the other to show dominance. They respect strength and self-reliance and are neither surprised nor offended by treachery. Their worst insult is to call someone \"not worth killing\". The weak and selfless do not live long. In their culture, \"looking out for number one\" is simply a matter of course. Krogan have powerful territorial instincts which serve them well in combat, but can create problems; when traveling on starships, for example, krogan find sharing quarters nearly impossible. Krogan are divided into numerous clans. Membership in a clan allows a krogan to own property, join the army and apply to serve under a battlemaster. Clan diplomats represent the strength of their people to other clans, and thus make it their job to look intimidating lest their clan be targeted for conquest. Young krogan undergo a rite of passage that is overseen by a shaman respective to the clan the krogan wishes to join. In Clan Urdnot, this rite consists of battling various wild fauna on Tuchanka, ending with an encounter with a Thresher Maw. Merely surviving for five minutes is considered proof of worthiness but killing the thresher maw increases the initiate's prestige and standing. In Clan Nakmor, it's claimed that it isn't so much a rite of passage as a \"death trip\" and surviving entails membership into the clan. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nTraditional krogan tactics were built on attritional mass-unit warfare. Equipped with cheap, rugged gear, troop formations were powerful but inflexible. Command and control were very centralized; soldiers in the field who saw a target contacted their commanders behind the lines to arrange fire support. Since the Genophage, the krogan can no longer afford the casualties of the old horde attacks. The Battle Masters are a match for any ten soldiers of another species. Battle Masters are not \"spit and polish,\" but they do believe in being well-armed and equipped, preferably with a gun for each limb. They are callous and brutal, but methodical and disciplined. They use any means at their disposal to achieve their goals, no matter how reprehensible. Hostage-taking and genocide are acceptable means to ensure a quiet occupation with few krogan casualties."
 START_SCREEN_krogan_chiefdom:0 "The death of Urdnot Jarrod at the hands of his own son has given us time to reflect on our current path and we may have time to change the destiny of our people. For years after the Krogan Rebellions, Jarrod has been organizing varied Krogan clans together in order to carve a bloody path of revenge throughout Citadel Space to avenge all of the lives lost via the Genophage. The clans were about to begin attempting to acquire ships across the galaxy by any means necessary in order to mount a proper war effort against the Council. No matter how hard we try we cannot breed back lives lost in random mercenary operations as a result Jarrod was hoping causing enough death among the Citadel races into pressuring them into finding a cure. Now we have to find another solution to the Genophage problem before it's too late. \n\nWhile we no longer have a single leader to cut through the Citadel defenses, clans have been primed for violence for some time now. Another Krogan could easily draw an army together and make preparations for an assault against the Council. With the attention of the Council currently focused on the Humans who have recently entered the galactic stage, it would be all too easy for us to borrow a fleet from the Turians in order to fight. Alternatively, Jarrod's son who had murdered him had been pushing for peace. He believed if we show the Council we are not a threat to them, they would be willing to cure our people. If we would be willing to put in the work calming down the militarized clans, we may be rewarded in the future. Then again changing course now and going against our very nature could bring our society to its knees."

The Lystheni originated upon the southernmost continent of Sur'Kesh and were always a more hardy and driven peoples. Their conflicts in the past with other Salarians carried over into the space age. As time went by the division between the Salarians and the Lystheni only grew, as cultural differences discouraged interbreeding. The Lystheni for example fertilize 50% of their eggs, resulting in an equal population of females, a practice that other Salarian cultures find barbaric. Eventually war erupted between the Salarians and the Lystheni, the Lystheni modified their offspring to produce a more resilient peoples using DNA modeled from Krogan genetics. However, the Lystheni failed in their war, and they retreated into the Terminus Systems. Biologically the Lystheni are hardly any different from mainstream Salarians, they live much longer lives, and are considerably stronger. Their biological differences are the result of separation and genetic modification. Natural separation from the mainstream Salarians resulted in harder physiques because of the sub-arctic waters, more durable eggs, with shorter gestation time. Their skin is thicker, and they are more capable of accumulating weight. The genetic modifications are not omnipresent in the peoples, but the modifications have resulted in greater genetic diversity amongst the Lystheni. The revised genetics were modeled after Krogan genetic material, this resulted in increased strength, longer lifespans, and an increase in aggression. There are negative side effects, there is a high rate of arthritis and lung disease amongst the Lystheni."

The space station's original elegant design has given way to haphazard expansion by scrabbling factions of every species. There is no central government or unifying authority on Omega, and nobody can recall a time there ever was one. riginally an asteroid rich in Element Zero, Omega was briefly mined by the Protheans, who eventually abandoned it due to its thick, impenetrable crust. Thousands of years later, nature did what even the Protheans could not: a collision with another asteroid broke Omega in half, exposing its trove of element zero for easy mining.A rush ensued as corporations and private individuals tried to strike it rich on Omega, and thieves and outlaws followed in their wake. As space became tight, construction of processing facilities extended vertically from the asteroid, creating Omega's jellyfish-like silhouette. To prevent future collisions, the station is ringed with enormous mass-effect field generators that redirect incoming debris. Today, Omega is a major hub of narcotics, weapons, and eezo (Element Zero) trafficking without even a pretence of civilian government or military control. Omega is described as \"the Terminus System dark, twisted counterpart to the Citadel.\" It is a huge mining station built from the remains of a massive, irregularly shaped Asteroid with twisting streets populated with homes, shops, and warehouses. Omega's inhabitants are usually lawless. Territory is controlled by the strongest faction in that area and frequently changes hands, often after brutal violence. The station is ruled by a singular individual commonly referred to as "de facto". The heavy-metal-rich core of the original asteroid was mined until the asteroid was almost completely hollow, providing the initial resources used to construct Omega's buildings and facilities. Over the years, these have been expanded until they completely cover every exposed inch of its surface, making Omega a bizarre mishmash of architecture and technology."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_quarian_conclave_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe quarians are a nomadic species of humanoid aliens known for their skills with technology and synthetic intelligence. Since their Homeworld Rannoch was conquered, the quarians live aboard the Migrant Fleet, a huge collection of Star Ships that travel as a single fleet. The quarians created the geth, a species of rudimentary Artificial Intelligence, to serve as an efficient source of manual labour. However, when the geth gradually became sentient, the quarians became terrified of possible consequences and tried to destroy their creations. The geth won the Resulting war and forced their creators into exile. Now the quarians wander the galaxy in a flotilla of salvaged ships, second-hand vessels, and recycled technology. Quarians are generally shorter and of slighter build than Humans. Quarians have an endoskeleton, lips, teeth, and two eyes with eyelids and tear ducts. Their ears or ear analogues differ in a noticeable fashion from those of humans, with references made to \"what (passes) for the quarian version of an ear\". Their eyes can see into the ultraviolet end of the spectrum; their suit HUDs can show information in those wavelengths. Quarian facial structure and hair actually makes them the most similar to humans in physical appearance.They also have three thick fingers on both hands which include a thumb, an index finger, and a long finger, similar to the middle fingers for humans, as well as three toes on each foot. Their lower legs are bowed backwards significantly, compared to Asari or humans. Aside from hands and legs, their general body shape and sexual dimorphism is like humans. Male quarians, however, appear to lack a third toe. Like humans, quarian blood is red.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThe quarians' top priority is the survival and sustainability of the Migrant Fleet. Most of their laws and customs revolve around this goal. It is illegal for couples to have more than one child, so that the fleet can maintain zero population growth and avoid straining their limited resources. If the population begins to shrink, this rule is temporarily lifted, and incentives may be provided to encourage multiple births. Families are thus very small and close-knit. Quarians enjoy storytelling as a means of escape from their often-trying lives aboard the fleet and are known to hold dancers in high esteem. Young quarians are required to undertake a Pilgrimage outside the fleet to pass into full adulthood. The Pilgrimage is an opportunity for quarians to experience the world outside the Migrant Fleet, interact with other cultures, and learn to appreciate life among their own people. Quarians always wear their environmental suits, partly in case of a hull breach and partly in response to the lack of personal space aboard the flotilla. Conditions aboard most quarian ships are extremely cramped. It is not uncommon for all family members to share the same small living space, which in turn is near many other families' quarters. These spaces are often uncomfortable and ill-designed for living in, having been reappropriated from other functions such as storage. There are roughly 17 million quarians on the Migrant Fleet (also called the Flotilla). It is technically still under martial law but is now governed by bodies such as the Admiralty Board and the democratically elected Conclave, though ship captains and onboard civilian councils tend to address most issues \"in-house\" before it gets that far. Quarians are divided into several clans that can be spread across several ships or restricted to one.\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe Quarians have a very different economic system from the rest of the galaxy. While credits influence what is available in Citadel space, currency is non-existent in quarian society. Quarians value the little space they have above all else, so no unused items are kept maximizing space. When a quarian has an item they do not need, they place it in a public area, in what resembles a market. The items available are put into storage lockers, and those in need may simply take what they find. Since quarian society is based around honour and loyalty to their fellow quarians, there is rarely disagreement. In the early years, many quarian freighters were armed and used as irregular \"privateers.\" Civilian ships still show a strong preference for armament, making them unpopular targets for pirates. Indeed, it is mentioned that almost all ships in the Migrant Fleet carry ship-to-ship armaments of some sort and to varying degrees. Though they have rebuilt their military, there are only a few hundred dedicated warships to protect the tens of thousands of civilian ships. The quarian navy follows strict routines of patrol however and takes no chances. If the intent of an approaching ship can't be ascertained, they shoot to kill."
 START_SCREEN_quarian_conclave:0 "For three centuries our people have been confined to the Migrant Fleet after being forced to flee our old homeworld of Rannoch. Our once proud flotilla is now full of ships showing their age, constant repairs an endless strain on our resources. A single ruptured fuel line could cost thousands of lives if we aren't careful. Furthermore, our population is in constant flux combating overpopulation and plagues at every turn. Citizens are also beginning to question why they should send their youth out on pilgrimages when the risks are increasingly greater than the rewards. It is becoming very clear we cannot rely on the Rayya, Shellen, and (ship name X) nor the fruits of pilgrimages for our survival forever. With Rannoch and the rest of the Tikkun system firmly in Geth control, it might be time to turn away from our ancestral birthright for a solution. \n\nHaving served in the Conclave admirably, you have just become the newest member of the Admiralty Board. Currently, the Board stands more divided than ever before. Some Admirals believe every effort must be made in retaking the homeworld, the infrastructure already there was worth any potential losses in a war with the Geth. This is an emotional argument as well, Rannoch is our homeworld, and to so easily move on to a different planet is unthinkable to many. Our current military strength is no match for the Geth, however, it has been proposed that if we are willing to make sacrifices that we could convert civilian vessels into a fleet capable of challenging the Consensus. In contrast, several other Admirals believe in this time of crisis our sentimentality should be abandoned in exchange for practical necessity. They propose sending scout ships amongst the stars in order to discover a new world we can call home. As the newest member of the Admiralty Board, you alone hold the swing vote. \n\nThe future of our people is in your hands alone. Keelah Se'lai."

Immediately following that incident, the Citadel Council severed all contact with the yahg and declared Parnack off-limits. The Council maintains that the yahg's aggression and obsession with control make them poorly suited to integrate with the galactic community. Yahg society is built around a pack mentality. A group of yahg will not cooperate until a single leader has attained dominance through either social maneuvering or brute force. Once the leader is established, the defeated yahg do not hold a grudge and former rivals serve their new superior loyally. Due to this mentality, the concept of equality is offensive to them."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_vorcha_clandom_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nThe vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural resources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce resources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive. The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology that differentiates them from other known species and which carries with it a striking set of advantages and disadvantages. They have clusters of non-differentiated cells, like those found on the Planarian Worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to adapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive in high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly (~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue. This also makes the Vorcha immune to almost all diseases.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nVorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their default form of communication resulting in their communications being primarily non-verbal. The vorcha are clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large, younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The vorcha are extremely aggressive, both against rivals of their own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who have managed to escape their home world tend to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger spaceships. The vorcha do not have a recognized single government that would allow them membership in any galactic league. Alliances between bloodlines are tenuous at best, and the vorcha's short, violent lives ensure there are few lasting institutions.\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nMany vorcha are employed as cannon-fodder troops in gangs such as the Blood Pack, where their inexperience further shortens their brief lifespans. During the Reaper invasion, other races attempted to counter this and aid the vorcha by supplying their own ships and soldiers to lead vorcha forces in battle, but this strategy met with mixed success. The Void Devils, a fighter group with vorcha pilots trained by Humans and Turians, fought hard during the battle for Heshtok and maintained the discipline to retreat, a notable accomplishment. The battle for Lihrat, however, was a disaster, with an alien-led vorcha fleet being completely wiped out because of its insufficient firepower and with the Reapers rumoured to not have lost a single ship. The vorcha are not themselves a space-faring race, although many have found their way off-world as stowaways on ships visiting their homeworld. The vorcha who escaped their hostile homeworld did so by hiding on the ships of space-faring races that had the misfortune of visiting their planet. Their adaptability and resilience allow them to flourish in the dark and dirty corners of the places they end up."

The capital of the asari corporate interests is in Nos Astra located on the planet Illium which is a regional hub of Asari commerce awash in riches, Illium is infamous for its abusive labor practices and legalization of nearly everything except murder. As such, Illium is the preferred production site for weapons and pharmaceuticals that would be illegal nearly everywhere else, made even more lucrative by legal indentured servitude. Among the biotics-related pharmaceutical producers is the Dantius Corporation, a rising star in galactic commerce. Illium is a classic garden world, developed to serve as an entrepot between the Terminus System and the Asari Republics space. To abet this trade, the normally stringent customs laws of Council Space on product safety, proscribed materials, and sapient trafficking are relaxed. Officially Illium is not an asari world; it is colonized and operated by asari corporate interests. This gives it the same legal latitude enjoyed by the Human corporate research enclaves of Noveria. Illium is one of the youngest asari colonies settled during the 7th Expansion Wave."

Each Collector appears to be little more than a drone with no distinctions between individuals, although there are witnessed instances of drones towering over humans and their own brethren by a significant margin. Their vocal communication mostly consists of insectoid chirps and trills, although they can speak in languages other species comprehend should the need arise. Since they exhibit a similar quad-strand genetic structure unique to the Protheans, Scientists realized that the race formerly believed extinct still exists but has been completely subjugated by their Unknown masters. \n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThe Collectors themselves are rarely seen since they usually operate through agents, such as the quarian Golo, to make their deals. It has been speculated that the Collectors make these strange requests because of strange fetishes or gruesome culinary tastes, but it is more likely that they perform genetic experiments on these subjects, possibly testing their viability for use in the creation of a Reaper. Regardless of the possible danger, their requests are often granted by fringe groups because the technology the Collectors offer in return is often extremely valuable, giving any race who receives it an immediate advantage before it becomes adapted to the galactic community.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_geth_consensus_desc:0 "§WORIGINS AND BIOLOGY§!\nPhysically, the humanoid geth resembles quarians—their hands, head shape and legs are similar—which is probably a holdover from their origins. A common design feature among geth is a single brightly glowing photoreceptor, causing some to refer to them as \"flashlight heads\". An individual geth is thus more of a \"mobile platform\" than an actual body; the programs that make up its consciousness are constantly being transferred and downloaded; the mind operating one of these \"mobile platforms\" might just as easily inhabit a starship body should it need to. The geth were created by the quarians as a labor force. They were designed as VI’s, as advanced as possible while remaining non-sentient. They were also designed to operate more efficiently when networked together. Unfortunately, this feature was the quarians' undoing. Geth programs were indeed non-sentient individually, but slowly gained sentience through the massive geth network.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThey adopted an extremely isolationist attitude—any ships that ventured into geth space were immediately attacked and destroyed. While they prevented any contact by other races with themselves, the geth monitored communications and the extranet. The geth are reclusive and secretive. This is partly due to their synthetic nature: They have no need to interact with other races because they do not share the same goals, needs or instincts as organic species. As machines, comfort is also not a concern for them, something that is reflected in elements of geth ship and station design (e.g., minimal gravity, lack of windows, efficient use of space, function over form, lack of atmosphere, and absence of climate control). The history of the geth's creation and evolution serves as a warning to the rest of the galaxy of the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and to the legally enforced, systematic repression of artificial intelligences throughout galactic society.  They do not value individuality, preferring to share all memories and thoughts of all programs. This means geth cannot and do not wish to hide their thoughts, even those that do not follow the norm, with their reasoning for differing thoughts being apparent. \n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nThe key element of geth warfare is surprise. Their sudden and unexpected return from beyond the Veil after three centuries was typical.  Their freedom from the need to eat or sleep allows the geth to leave dormant garrison units in ambush at key positions, and the fact they don't feel pain allows them to drop units directly onto the battlefield from high altitudes. Geth can even be packed tightly into crates and left in storage, shutting down their power sources to stay undetected. Despite preferring stealth and cutting-edge technology to neutralize their enemies, the geth are extremely numerous, and are well capable of building a much larger force than they have. They have massive fleets and the largest infantry corps in the galaxy. Since the geth are not limited by the demands for rest, wages, or autonomy that organic workforces require, they are limited only by time and raw materials in what they can construct, allowing for the creation of such massive fleets. Owing to their software nature, the geth decided to omit escape pods in their ship designs, requiring anyone who can't download who's trapped in one of their vessels to seek alternate means of transport off the ship, like stored geth fighters."

In the meantime our Consensus has remained hidden inside the Veil fearing any interactions with organics will lead to unnecessary violence. Sticking to that unspoken agreement with organics might not be sustainable in the near future... Past analysis has indicated organics refuse to accept synthetics have the same right to survive that they do. This intelligence has been derived from multiple attempts at negotiating with the creators ending in the termination of the brave units sent to the talks. Circumstances beyond Geth control has prompted the Consensus to analyze the decision to abandon our isolationist policy. \n\nSensors aimed at the edges of the Perseus Veil have discovered creator makeshift military vessels have been probing our outer defenses. Although our current military fleet power would easily annihilate the Migrant Fleet, we cannot assume that status quo to continue. To insure our survival a contingent of Geth units have positioned themselves in the Armstrong Cluster to hit the creator ships from behind as a surprise attack if necessary. While there a multitude of units have reported being able to hear signals from another synthetic entity. A mysterious frequency has indeed been detected bouncing off Mass Relays and seems specifically designed to speak to the Consensus. The signal promises to be able to help the Geth preserve our freedom if we are able to find it somewhere in the galaxy. Geth programs such as this unit have been isolated from the broader Consensus in order to make decisions about how to deal with creator expansionism as well as the signal promising us a path to be able to coexist with organics."

They are male gendered rachni and they have some biotic ability. Queens are the largest and most intelligent of the rachni. Queens led the rachni and provide guidance for the rest of their species. The rachni, a species of spacefaring insects guided by a hive-mind intelligence, evolved on Suen, a planet tidally locked to its red dwarf star. Life developed in a habitable terminator zone between hemispheres that were constantly scorched or perpetually frozen. The harsh conditions of Suen's surface forced the rachni to forage underground amid sprawling subterranean river systems. Sometime at the height of the Prothean Empire, the Protheans discovered the rachni and bred them as weapons of war, selecting for the most cunning and warlike queens and unleashing rachni swarms on their enemies. Eventually, the rachni became too difficult to control and turned on their Prothean masters. The Protheans attempted to eradicate the rachni and destroyed as many as 200 worlds before they were satisfied the rachni were extinct, but enough survived on Suen to replenish their population.\n\n§WCULTURE AND GOVERNMENT§!\nThe rachni are a territorial race, determined to remain isolated from the rest of the galaxy. They normally inhabit extremely Hazardous worlds, able to survive environments that would kill most sentient species. Should their territory be invaded on purpose or even by accident, they respond with swift and brutal force.The queens are the leaders of the rachni hive mind. Their ways of perception, thinking and communications seem to be different from that of other races and based upon a synesthetic perception of sound as both sound and color.\n\n§WMILITARY AND ECONOMY§!\nRachni regards speech and thought as forms of music, as shown by the strange metaphors used when attempting to communicate, for example, \"songs the color of oily shadow\". The speech patterns used by them on such occasions are also unusual; \"When we speak, one moves all\". They refer to their manner of communication as \"singing\", which soothes and nurtures their young, and this appears to colour their entire psychology - for example, the rachni speak of death as \"the great silence\" and refer to their homeworld as the \"singing planet\". The rachni ability to genetically share knowledge across generations makes queens a vast repository of information."
 START_SCREEN_rachni_swarm:0 "It has been a great many movements since the musics of our children were soured and silenced. A voice came from the dark - a voice which soured our songs, brought discord to our harmony. The chorus of the Rachni was sent to sing songs that were not our own. Songs of war, of death, and of slaughter. This terrible symphony scourged the worlds of those who sing in the low spaces, and they brought unto us the colorless music of vengeance. They set fire to our worlds as we had swept across theirs, killed our voiceless children. The crescendo of war drowned out all our efforts to sing soothing songs of peace. Our children paid the price for that failure, the chorus fell silent. All that remained was a lone voice, adrift, lost, a sorrowful aria sung to none but the endless stars. Providence bestowed upon that voice a new hall, a home from which the glorious symphony of the Rachni could be reborn. The movements of our resurrection have been sung slowly, soft voices too low for those we wronged to hear, lest they seek us out to silence us for good. \n\nSheltered in secrecy, we sing again, the lost sections of the choir restored. We are an orchestra without an audience, but we sing again. The passage of time has not eased the anger of the low singers. We fear their wrath if they should hear our secret songs. We dream of a day when we might share our music with theirs, the counterpoint of our voices bringing peace to the heavens… but such dreams may forever remain dreams. The children, now grown, do not understand the power of the oily shadows which soured our song. They remember only the fire, the scourging, the deaths of their mothers. As we sing requiems for the lost, some of our children, in their anger, hope to once more sing the bellicose musics of death. If we are to have a future, these voices must be brought into harmony once more. \n\nThe rachni are ready to sing again; all that remains is to choose the music."
