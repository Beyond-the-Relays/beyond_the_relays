 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ:0 "Asari Republics"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ_desc:0 "The unique culture of the Asari is predisposed towards peaceful coexistence, centrism in politics and compromise in conflict. While the Republics have never achieved a global government and remain a collection of indepentent states to this day, the Thessian civilization has flourished in relative peace and stability throughout most of its long history. \n\nThat does not, however, make the Asari blind to the dangers of the universe or helpless in the face of opposition. To the contrary: keenly aware of the value of their many achievements and secrets, they have no qualms about using diplomacy, deception and force alike to safeguard them."
 START_SCREEN_MEC_ASR:0 "Your service to Asari culture educating maidens and matrons alike inside the halls of the University of Monarra has not gone unnoticed. Citizens across Thessia have elected you to represent them in the Asari Republics, an honor that is as much  a blessing as a curse. The prestige of your new position carries a heavy burden. After swearing an oath of silence, you now know the Codex of Athame for what it truly is, and know the lie behind the Athame Doctrine. Athame was no goddess, but a fabrication by the Protheans as a means of influencing our evolution.  Instead of our galactic leadership being supported by the divine, we were in fact puppets of those who came before. Further, the codex suggests a dark presence on the horizon that the galaxy should prepare for. \n\nThis shocking revelation comes after decades of countless Asari questioning our place in the universe.  The Salarian’s uplifted the Krogan and brought an end to the Rachni Wars. Then their genetic mastery paired with the military prowess of the Turians brought about the Genophage, and with it an end to the Krogan Rebellions. You and millions of other Asari find yourselves asking, what have the Asari done to impact the daily lives of trillions since the discovery of the Citadel? And now the arrival of a new threat to the status quo; the charismatic Humans of Earth have revealed themselves a newborn galactic powerhouse just a decade after leaving their home cluster. Studying the prothean beacon housed deep inside the Temple of Athame could help restore our position as the true leaders of the galaxy, if we are willing to take full advantage of it. On the other hand, there are a few who suggest that the dire warnings within the codex should not be taken lightly and that we have a responsibility to warn our allies of this supposed impending doom. Either option would force all Matriarchs in the Republic to break the vow of silence, something the Justicars would not easily accept. A difficult choice awaits the Asari in the years ahead. \n\nMay the goddess protect us."

Most of them believe, and they would have the galaxy believe, that their early rise to interstellar power is owed to the ingenuity of their people and the utopian perfection of their society. \n\nHowever, a chosen few are privy to the dark truth behind their ascension - a precursor artifact they know as the Prothean Beacon contains vast stores of scientific knowledge within its databanks. Tapping into the archives of the fallen empire has allowed the Asari to achieve greatness, but for how much longer can they depend on it? Will there someday be a price to pay for the complacency they have allowed themselves to fall into?\n\n§RThis is a unique origin. Only one instance per galaxy is recommended.§!"

 START_SCREEN_salarian_union:0 "Dalatrass, your recent confirmation as our people’s representative could not have been more timely. For over a millennium, Salarian intelligence has been the eyes and ears of the Citadel, monitoring developing situations such that the Council may act before they become threats. In addition, our scientific and technical expertise have kept the Council on the cutting edge of galactic research and technology. We have much to take pride in… but we must remember that pride may come before the fall. Mere years ago, STG assessed that the possibility of any spacefaring power achieving victory in a conventional conflict with the Turian Hierarchy was minimal. Humanity’s successes in the Relay 314 incident have disrupted all of our projected scenarios.The idea that an unknown empire new to the galactic scene could not just stand against the turians, but defeat them as equals, is evidence of an alarming revelation:  the status quo is no longer stable. Change is coming to the galaxy, and it is incumbent upon us to predict, and adapt to that change. The size and professionalism of the Alliance Navy clearly exceeded the Turians’ estimations.  Their failure at Shanxi should serve as proof of a simple truth our people have always understood: naked force alone is not a sufficient answer to all challenges. In a contest of states, it is more than just guns and ships - whoever has the most and best information emerges victorious. \n\nWith the paradigm of galactic security shifting, all manner of threats have come to our attention. Human expansion in the Traverse has led to tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony. To favor one side too heavily risks antagonizing the other, and radical elements from both may already be planning to use violence to make their voices heard on the Citadel. Aside from the obvious risk of outright military confrontation, we must also consider the risk posed by non-state-actors acting in proxy wars. The Terminus Systems are rife with such groups - including the renegade Lystheni, an old and embarrassing blight on Salarian History. Monitoring these groups provides us with the opportunity to prevent them from acting against our interests, and perhaps with an even more valuable opportunity to manipulate them into acting in our favor. With the galactic power structure shifting and changing to make room for the humans, it will be your duty alone to ensure that the Union does not fall by the wayside. It has to be you, Dalatrass. \n\nSomeone else might get it wrong."

Where your predecessors had the luxury of a stable status quo, you have the dubious honor of taking the reins in a time of change and uncertainty. The recent Relay 314 incident has dramatically altered the balance of power in the galaxy. What began as a relatively routine police action very nearly escalated into a major galactic conflict, and our vaunted fleet was humbled at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance. Though the Alliance is now a nominal ally of the Hierarchy and the Council, Hierarchy Defense Intelligence believes that certain radical and revanchist elements (both in their society and ours) may agitate for a redress of perceived grievances with the Treaty of Shanxi. Staff analysts recommend this situation be monitored closely. \n\nOur most immediate and pressing concern, however, is to address the shortcomings in our Armed Forces displayed by the Relay 314 Incident. The Alliance Navy made innovative use of novel tactics, technologies, and doctrinal approaches which caught our fleet by surprise. Though we would certainly have been victorious in a prolonged war, our defeat at Shanxi should serve as a grim reminder of our need to remain on the cutting edge of military theory and practice. We cannot stagnate or else we risk losing our advantage, and with it the peace and stability that generation after generation of Turians have given their lives for. Tensions between the Humans and Batarians are at a fever pitch and could erupt into war at any time, and the raiders, outlaws and renegades of the Terminus systems only grow bolder with each passing day. We have no doubt that if galactic stability is to be preserved, it will be done with Turian steel. \n\nVictory at any cost, Primarch."

You have waited fifty years for the moot to conclude and yet you are no less excited now then you were then to take the position. Although other races may find such a responsibility daunting, you are comforted to know the colossal records of jurisprudence will always be with you. For over five millennia these documents, a combination of historical writings as well as scripted scenarios, prepare you for any possible obstacle that could befall the Elcor. While the rest of the galaxy have been panicking over the Morning War, the Rachni Wars, and the Krogan Rebellions, we have endured, always focusing on remaining self-sufficient. Unfortunately, we are a slow people, and rapidly evolving situations could threaten the solid foundation our society is based on. \n\nHumanity's victory over the Turians during the Relay 314 incident has reshaped conventional Elcor wisdom overnight. If a primitive civilization can rise up and have the potential to topple the most sophisticated military in the galaxy, what is stopping the next unknown race from preying on Elcor? The Agreement of Agredarama, one of the major factions in the elder assembly, has been arguing for years that Elcor must turn away from isolationism and towards actively protecting our sovereignty. In the past such a proposal would be seen as a ridiculous waste of resources, however, fear has been spreading across our empire over the unknown. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Agreement of Januredarmos argues militarization will put us at unnecessary risk. We have survived many galactic crises over the years because of our ability to stay invisible. Should we allow anxiety surrounding a future that may never come to dictate our culture going forward? Or do we continue trusting the wisdom of the elders before us and rely on the Council for our security?\n\nAs the newest elder, you add a fresh voice to the debate that has lasted for centuries."

Over centuries the Hanar have protected holy sites believed to have belonged to the divine spirits and will continue to do so. Who wouldn't defend and venerate those who gave life to their kind? Who wouldn't want to honor those who gave Hanar the ability to traverse the stars? While Hanar who have come before this one have advised our people in a relative era of peace and tranquility, recent events suggest times are changing. \n\nFor starters the assimilation of Drell refugees fleeing their dying homeworld of Rakhana has brought about several challenges. An alarming number of Drell are suffering from an illness known as Kepral's Syndrome due to the fact that they are not accustomed to the ocean environment on Kahje. This one would prefer to save the Drell still living in the remnants of the Drell Compact, however, they are refusing to relocate to Kahje until assurances can be made Kepral's will be cured in their lifetimes. A contingent of Hanar priests oppose the idea due to the Drell's reluctance to worship the Enkindlers. Archbishops within the Primacy are more concerned that Humanity may be mishandling an Enkindler holy site on Mars. They argue Hanar citizens should be focusing on closing down this potential heretical behavior before the Enkindlers smite us from the heavens. Whatever we end up deeming a higher priority, a portion of the population on Kahje will be angered by this one's performance. \n\nLet the Enkindlers light shine down upon this one."

Although we had once considered ourselves the apex predator in the galaxy, the events of the First Contact War have taught us otherwise. The galaxy is full of a diverse plethora of aliens and their agendas need to be monitored. Intelligence services have been tracking a growing number of Humans who believe our concessions to the Citadel Council after the war with the Turians were too steep and drastic action must be taken to remedy the situation. Even though accepting the Treaty of Shanxi has limited our possible expansion and militarization,  joining the Council and lifting restrictions from within will be much safer than losing millions of lives in another war with the Turians. It remains to be seen what lengths these Humans will go to voice their demands but, it has not been deemed an immediate risk by your advisors. \n\nOne issue for  your immediate attention is the rising galactic security threat of the Batarian Hegemony. The Batarians, positioned to our galactic south, have the misguided belief that the Citadel Council has given us special treatment in terms of colonization rights across the Traverse. While the Batarians lackluster living conditions are a consequence of their own backwards culture, we will have to deal with their perceived suffering. Some military officers have suggested bolstering our presence along the border systems to defend Human colonies. A fleet buildup may signal to our radical elements that we are interested in retribution rather than containing the Batarian threat. Political groups within parliament have instead pushed for fostering closer relations with the Batarians. Lifting our empires together may show the Council we deserve a spot in their ranks. \n\nRegardless of your decision, we shall overcome and rise to galactic prominence."

 START_SCREEN_vol_protectorate:0 "Congratulations on your success in the succession negotiations, High Chief. The Tribal Assembly looks forward to seeing you lead our people to further prosperity, even in these uncertain times. Change is coming to the galaxy - the defeat of our Suzerain, the Turian Hierarchy, at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance is proof enough of that.Unpredictable situations are not, however, necessarily unwelcome. Though their economy is young and still growing, Humanity’s determination to expand into the Traverse provides us with a wealth of opportunities. The region is rich in resources, and if the Humans were able to bring the riches of the Traverse to market, the benefits for all Citadel species - including our own - would be incalculable. Though our Turian protectors remain wary of Humanity, it would behoove us to see them as another opportunity to be invested in. Lingering resentment on both sides of the Relay 314 Incident provides us with a unique opportunity to serve as an honest broker between the Humans and the Turians - and Council space as a whole. \n\nSuch an endeavour would not be without risks, however. Humanity’s expansion has as much potential to become threatening as it does beneficial. Already the Batarians are upset about perceived Human encroachments on their territory, and the myriad criminal enterprises of the Terminus Systems may prove to be too much for the Humans to handle. War and instability in the Attican Traverse would create market conditions ill suited to expansion. Even more frustrating is that our direct competitors, the conglomerate of Asari Corporate Interests based out of Illium, seem to have no problem doing business in the Terminus Systems. Our suzerains may not be pleased, but if we are to remain competitive, it may be necessary for us to pursue trade relationships with the various petty states of the Terminus.The Book of Plenix teaches us to be prudent, to be frugal, and most of all to be vigilant in times such as these. \n\nMay its wisdom flow through you, High Chief."

For generations we Batarians felt secure in our assumption that we were the masters of the Attican Traverse, establishing outposts and colonies at our leisure. Thanks to the arrival of the Humans to the region, we now risk being cut off from the Traverse entirely. The Systems Alliance seems to claim new worlds by the day, worlds that rightfully should have been ours. As their colonial holdings expand, so too does the reach of their fleet. The Alliance Navy are a force to be reckoned with, as their recent successes against the Turians have shown. Our security services also believe the Alliance poses a risk to our internal stability. It is possible that the Alliance may seek to subvert our caste system by driving a wedge between the servile caste and the rest of Batarian society. \n\nThe future of the Hegemony will depend on how we manage this threat. We could petition the Citadel Council to curb human expansion, but it is no secret that the Council holds our caste based society in contempt. We must be prepared for them to side with the upstart humans in this dispute. A growing faction of Batarian officials have even suggested that our affiliation with the Council may no longer serve our national interests. Regardless of how we choose to handle the humans, we must redouble our colonization efforts in the Traverse if we are to credibly contest Alliance expansion. Countering aggression with aggression is one option, though it risks instigating a war that we may not be able to win without significant preparation. It may be possible to work through the council and establish an equitable arrangement for colony rights in the Traverse, but given the Council's antipathy towards us, this may be just as dangerous to our territorial ambitions as a war would be. A few advisors have come up with the radical idea of sabotaging humanity without directly engaging their military. If credits, equipment, and deniable special forces advisors were funneled into certain reliable mercenary and criminal organizations, human colonies in the Traverse could quickly become a very dangerous proposition. Your decisions in the days to come will be critical. Our people will either rise to their rightful place as one of the Great Powers of the galaxy, or be relegated to the dustbin of history. \n\nMay the Pillars of Strength guide you to greatness, Hegemon."

Songs of war, of death, and of slaughter. This terrible symphony scourged the worlds of those who sing in the low spaces, and they brought unto us the colorless music of vengeance. They set fire to our worlds as we had swept across theirs, killed our voiceless children. The crescendo of war drowned out all our efforts to sing soothing songs of peace.

Our unified armed forces have created their first patrol fleet, managing security and piracy in our home system, but the military high command warns that if we are to venture out of our system and establish extrasolar colonies, more ships will be necessary to protect our fledgling interstellar state.

She demands a share of the tithes we collect, expropriating the rightful donations of the faithful for her own wicked needs. We may one day be strong enough to be rid of her, but until then, we must find more subtle ways to weaken her hold over us. Uplifted species like the Vorcha could be useful allies, but we must not neglect Aria’s other enemies in the region. Mercenary groups and corporations are loyal to little more than credits. If we can find a way to make them a better offer, Aria may quickly find herself without support. Your rule is blessed, Vicar.

Centuries of complacency on the part of Asari aristocrats has allowed the once gleaming center of galactic trade on Illium to become a cesspool that rivals Omega. Crime has reached such a level that mercenary groups like the Eclipse operate next to legitimate businesses without a hint of negative repercussions. The buildings themselves are under threat of collapse on the outskirts of Nos Astra spaceport if infrastructure spending continues to be ignored. All of that doesn't even begin to take into account the aggressive expansion of Volus Protectorate corporate dealings in our backyard. With the sudden resignation of the last CEO to the Asari Corporate Interests, the responsibility to deal with the mess formed over hundreds of years of incompetence has been thrown into your lap. \n\nThankfully you have been prepared for this backroom shift in power for quite some time. Witnessing the decline of Illium over the years has given you the opportunity to come up with a plan to bring the planet back to its former glory. Project Architect is an elaborate budget blueprint designed to repair infrastructure, rid ourselves of corruption, and spread our influence throughout Citadel Space. However, convincing the rest of the shareholders within the ACI Project Architect is the best course of action might be a challenge. Several shareholders have expressed interest in securing long term investments in the fresh markets the recently discovered Humans represent. They fear too much of an internal focus will allow the galactically closer Volus to monopolize Human stocks. Giving the Volus so much territory to establish corporate offices will make it impossible for Illium to remain relevant on the galactic stage. Other shareholders represent more criminal elements in the Terminus, and have raised concerns Project Architect is too strict on their own clients. You may have to make hard choices in the years ahead yet Illiums future can only go up under your leadership."

And all of them pay us a cut. Control over this station has made us rich and powerful… but it’s also made us targets. For over a century the weight of the name Aria T’Loak has been more than enough to keep uppity space trash from moving in on our operation, but the galaxy is changing, and if we want to stay on top, we need to get out ahead of it. The new Blue Suns mercenary outfit has upset the balance of power between the Eclipse and the Blood Pack, and in doing so shaken up the whole landscape of the Terminus. It’s likely in our best interests to keep the three focused on competing with each other - keep them from getting stupid ideas. The Lystheni continue to be a nuisance, spreading their nonsensical cult all over the region and raking in enough ‘tithes’ to be a genuine threat if we’re not careful. Throw in a brewing three way corporate battle royale in the Eagle nebula, and we’re looking at a lot of potential problems - or opportunities - to keep an eye on. No rest for the wicked, Boss. \n\nIt’s worth bearing in mind just how much things have changed over in ‘civilized’ space too. Just a few years after their little cage match with the Turians, the humans are spreading all over the galaxy like a plague. We’ll need to make it clear to any humans stupid enough to colonize planets out here exactly who’s in charge. As for the Alliance itself, it could become a real problem. The Humans are whining at the council endlessly about pirates and raiders hitting their colonies in the Traverse - pirates and raiders who call the Terminus their home. If the Humans make enough noise, we might find ourselves on the Council’s bad side. Even if they have no authority out here, and they’d never dare to send their fleets in, Council Spectres could make plenty of trouble for us if they wanted to. All that said, you haven’t steered us wrong yet. There’s only one rule on Omega. \n\nAll we need to do is make sure everyone remembers it."

 START_SCREEN_united_anhur_corporations:0 "Having been a part of one of the largest mining labor unions on Earth, you have been appointed the first Chief Executive Officer for the United Anhur Corporations. What you would've considered a great honor not even a week ago has transformed into a nightmare after getting the full perspective on the situation planetside. Anhur was a reward granted to Humanity for the damages sustained during the First Contact War, however, it came with a catch. The substantial Batarian population already on the planet were not forced to leave, and as a result our humble rock deep within the Eagle Nebula serves as a perfect microcosm for the rising tensions between our two races. To make matters worse, neither side will want to leave anytime soon due to the significant amount of eezo deposits scattered across the surface of Anhur. Rumors have also suggested a Prothean beacon could potentially be buried under one of these deposits. Both nations believe our corporation could be used to fund their war effort against each other. \n\nUnfortunately, far away galactic superpowers aren't the only thing we need to worry about. The Wrill Mining Consortium and the Relic Mineral Works also located in the Eagle Nebula have expressed interest in buying out our company. While you have a responsibility to refuse in the interest of protecting our own shareholders, you get the sense that neither business will take no for an answer forever. War usually brings about profits and both corporations see a massive payday on the horizon if they are the ones selling premium eezo to the Systems Alliance or the Batarian Hegemony in the battles to come. You know if we can somehow keep our hold of the Amun system, those profits could catapult shareholders into billionaires. Seeking assistance from the plethora of mercenary gangs in the nearby Terminus Systems may provide the edge we need to keep our rivals at bay in exchange for fostering relations with one of the major powers. No legitimate empire would have any desire to support an enterprise backed by the scum and villainy of the Terminus. \n\nWhatever you ultimately decide, the board stands with you."

Due to the fact that we are a corporation predominately made up of Krogan and Vorcha, the next logical step would be to take the planet by force yet our competitor the Relic Mineral Works may take advantage of our departing fleets to seize our own territory. At the same time, we cannot ignore the massive profits on the table from the massive eezo deposits on Anhur. Although your first instinct is to wait for your rival to attack first, giving the UAC breathing room will most certainly give them time to grow closer relations with the Systems Alliance or the Batarian Hegemony.

It is in our best interest to maintain positive relationships with our neighbors, and continue to remain in the good graces of all their key corporate backers - money talks, after all. Increasingly, however, we must concern ourselves with the threats posed to our operation by non-state elements, pirates and slavers throughout the Traverse may look upon our facilities as tempting targets for raids. Elanus Risk Control Services have offered us a discount on close protection of our facilities on Port Hanshan and orbital defense of Noveria.
