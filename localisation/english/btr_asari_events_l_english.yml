 btr_asari_writings.1.a.desc:0 "Several historians from the [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] Guildhall have come to the [Root.Owner.GetName] government with a request for an expedition to recover the writings of Matriarch Dilinaga.\n\nInterstellar colonization sparked a golden age of learning and cultural advancement for the [asariSpecies.GetName]. During this time, some Matriarchs became obsessed with achieving 'ultimate knowledge'. To that end, a small but dedicated group chose to leave [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] hoping to find greater wisdom and true enlightenment.\n\nWithin a span of a few years, twenty-eight Matriarchs left [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] with no destination in mind and no plan to return. Only six were ever heard from again. Of the other twenty-two, only Matriarch Dilinaga's remains were discovered, along with several writings made during her journey.\n\nThough many of the Matriarch's writings have already been discovered and researched, many still remain unaccounted for, thus preventing historians from fully understanding Dilinaga's wisdom and discoveries.\n\nWith the authorisation of the [Root.Owner.GetName] government, an expedition can be sent to the theorised locations of the Matriarch's writings."

As such, there is nothing stopping us from searching ourselves.\n\nWith the authorisation of the [Root.Owner.GetName] government, an expedition can be sent to the theorised locations of the Matriarch's writings."

It's not clear who lived here, but it appears to have been abandoned for some time. A container in one of the camp's tents held, among other things, one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings."
 btr_asari_writings.3.desc:0 "On arrival at [From.From.GetName] the [Root.GetName]'s sensors detected a strange signal originating from orbit. [Root.GetLeaderName] determined the signal was from an ancient beacon. The [Root.GetName]'s salvage team brought the beacon aboard and found one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings in its storage compartment."
 btr_asari_writings.4.desc:0 "Scans of [From.From.GetName] revealed debris from a destroyed [asariSpecies.GetName] freighter. Further scans uncovered a body, which was brought on board the [Root.GetName]. The ships chief medical officer examined it but learned nothing about its origins. Among the [asariSpecies.GetName]'s personal effects, however, was one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings."
 btr_asari_writings.5.desc:0 "Scans performed by the [Root.GetName], revealed a wrecked freighter orbiting one of [From.From.GetName]'s smaller moons. A recon team found no signs of life, but they did recover one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings."
 btr_asari_writings.6.desc:0 "Scans of the planet [From.From.GetName] revealed the flight deck of an unknown race's trading vessel. There are no signs of the rest of the ship, but the salvage team deployed from the [Root.GetName] discovered one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings in the ship's systems."
 btr_asari_writings.7.desc:0 "While exploring the surface of [From.From.GetName] for signs of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings, the crew of the [Root.GetName] discovered a small Prothean ruin. Nearby, they also discovered a wrecked [asariSpecies.GetName] shuttle. Inside was the ancient remains of an [asariSpecies.GetName]. More interestingly, they had on them one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings. It is possible the writings came from the nearby ruins."

 btr_asari_writings.9.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] recovered a strange object orbiting [From.From.GetName]. Several crew members tried unsuccessfully to determine its origin. They did, however, find one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings stored within."
 btr_asari_writings.10.desc:0 "On the surface of [From.From.GetName], a survey team sent by the [Root.GetName] in orbit, has found a remote shack in a valley. Close to a transmitter next to the shack, the survey team's comms picks up a recording of a wistful string quartet. They then powered the system down. Whoever lived here, they haven't been back for some time. The crates are covered with [From.From.GetName]'s chalky dust, and the status lights of the shack indicate its atmosphere ran out long ago.\n\nSifting through a pile of debris, a member of the survey team discovers another of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings. It's in bad shape, but most of it is still intact.\n\nWhoever lived here and why they had one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings in their possession, will remain a mystery."
 btr_asari_writings.11.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s survey team on the surface of [From.From.GetName], has come across a small, isolated habitat building. Outside lie the remains of two mercenaries. Both have suffered from bullet wounds to their chests. The lack of dust build-up on their bodies indicates their deaths were relatively recent, perhaps in the last two years.\n\nInside the barren habitat a storage crate is discovered. Prying open the crate, the team finds a carefully wrapped, handwritten copy of one of Matriarch Dilinaga's treatises. It is unlikely she penned it herself, but the following brushwork and intricate watercolour illustrations clearly show the hand of a master scribe."

We must now decide what to do with the collection. While holding countless insights, they are sure to be far more valuable and useful to their rightful owner, the [asari_republics.GetName].\n\nWe could keep the writings to ourselves and reap the benefits, a move, if the [asari_republics.GetName] ever were to discover would undoubtably cause a great diplomatic uproar. A potentially safer option being, of course, is to instead give them back to the [asari_republics.GetName]."
