 mec_eg_site.20911.desc:0 "Our excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have confirmed that the burial ground is in fact Prothean. Most importantly, our team has identified no signs of looting or interference, meaning this site is one of a few in the galaxy that has been undisturbed for 50,000 years. Understandably, this has led to requests from across our civilization to be a part of this archaeological dig. \n\nCurrently, our excavation team are focused on surveying and securing the site, ensuring that the entire area is thoroughly examined before any further research is undertaken. Additional security personnel are being requested by [Root.GetLeaderName] due to the scientific and material value of the site."

 mec_eg_site.20912.name:0 "Examining the Dead"
 mec_eg_site.20912.desc:0 "Following extensive surveys of the entire planet, [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported that there are over two hundred graves on [From.Planet.GetName]. A small number of the graves have been examined in detail, with samples being taken from the remains and various artifacts being catalogued. \n\nFrom these initial artifacts, a clearer picture has emerged. All of the graves so far are that of soldiers or soldier equivalents, adorned in a ceremonial armor with a rifle and blade alongside them. It would not be prudent to assume that the Protheans were inherently a militarist civilization, but from what has been examined it is safe to argue that their soldiers were given a high level of respect. \n\nThree graves in particular are extremely important in our understanding of the Protheans. The remains within these graves are of a different species, with four upper appendages and two lower, standing and locomotion limbs. They are distinctly smaller than the dominant species. The most numerous species are humanoid, with what appear to be two pairs of eye sockets in their skull. \n\nBased on the gravesites it is clear that both species were buried respectfully and equally. There are no indications that one species was higher on the social hierarchy within this context. \n\nThe research team's next step is to analyse any and all genetic samples, as well as carefully examine the remaining graves. \n\nAdditionally, [Root.GetLeaderName] has added an addendum to their report, saying that it has been found that [From.Planet.GetName] is rich in high value minerals and element zero. Exploiting these resources may be beneficial following our excavation."

 mec_eg_site.20913.name:0 "Buried Fighter"
 mec_eg_site.20913.desc:0 "The excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have uncovered a highly unique gravesite. Underneath the body of a humanoid Prothean, adorned in a flight-suit with a sidearm and various other artifacts, was a buried starfighter. The starfighter was painted in gunmetal grey with bright green highlights along the fuselage, wings and weapon hardpoints. There are clear marks near the cockpit indicating the pilot's kill count which number at forty-one. It is therefore likely that being buried with one's starfighter was a great honor for any pilot. The lack of other remains clothed in a flight suit is an intriguing oddity. \n\nIt is still unclear if the graves are all from a singular battle or conflict, nor is it clear why [From.Planet.GetName] is the final resting place of these soldiers. This is especially true due to the complete lack of evidence suggesting any kind of conflict took place in the local system. \n\nThe starfighter itself has been meticulously scanned and has offered some intriguing insights in regards to it's reactor core and shielding technology. Our science teams are already investigating possible improvements to our fighter-craft and other starships."

 mec_eg_site.20914.name:0 "DNA Structure"
 mec_eg_site.20914.desc:0 "Our science team have had a major breakthrough on [From.Planet.GetName] in respect to biological samples taken from the graves. [Root.GetLeaderName] has confirmed that the humanoid species have a unique DNA structure. The majority of known life in the galaxy uses the double-helix DNA structure, whereas the humanoid Protheans have a quad-strand DNA structure, It is speculated that quad-strand DNA has in-built functions similar to epigenetic markers as well as being involved in the reading of genetic code and the production of proteins. \nFurthermore, some distinct variations have been identified between the humanoid species, however, what these distinctions mean and how they'd represent themselves is impossible to know. \n\nUnfortunately, all the genetic samples taken from the other species are too damaged to analyse. Our research team will continue excavating the area for any additional artifacts and information."

 mec_eg_site.20915.desc:0 "No further artifacts and information of note has been identified by our research team on [From.Planet.GetName]. As noted by [Root.GetLeaderName] previously, the detailed survey of the planet identified the presence of high value minerals, including element zero. This information has now become public knowledge, and a variety of mining organizations and corporations are requesting permission to set-up camps to explore the feasibility of mining the area. \n\nAs one would expect, a significant number of scientists are demanding that [From.Planet.GetName] is declared a planet of galactic heritage. A decision is needed as to the future of the planet."

Clearly desiring the immense archaeological wealth for the blackmarket, they were fortunately repulsed by our security forces. Whilst none of the archaeological team were injured, a few security personnel were killed in the attack. Further security arrangements are being made to ensure such an event cannot occur again."

Yet, among the ruins there may still be secrets left to uncover and relics to be used after millennia of neglect. Our excavation teams have prepared a base camp and are starting the long and slow process of clearing a path deeper into the facilities and cataloguing everything and anything that we come across."

 btr_site.102.desc:0 "We have managed to enter the main facility and have begun to search for any information about the facility or the Protheans themselves. While we have no found anything that truly revolutionizes our understanding of this ancient culture, we believe that we have picked up a trail. The facility appears to have been used to study our prehistoric selves. Most of what we have uncovered has shed light on our own evolution but as we clear more areas and access more terminals, we are putting together a mosaic of what it was like to work here when it was operating."

 btr_site.103.name:0 "A time away"
 btr_site.103.desc:0 "The majority of the facility has been cleared and now its large empty halls are used infrequently by members of our team who have been desperately fixing terminals and reactivating data archives. We have not found any remains which would point to the facility being abandoned but it also follows the trend of Prothean sites being devoid of any organic remains. It has been an unnerving experience so far, reinhabiting the lifeless husk of an ancient civilization and the facility exudes a sombreness that is difficult to describe. We are still unsure why the facility was placed here to watch over us, but we do know that our prehistoric ancestors did not impress the scientists. Strangely, none of the files we have analysed so far has mentioned the facility being abandoned."

 btr_site.104.desc:0 "We have been successful in our efforts to resurrect much of the ancient data archives and have been able to learn small amounts about them and the facility itself. Apparently personal privacy was not a high priority for these outposts as nearly every message was catalogued and archived giving us great insight into several scientists lives but having little else to go off of it is impossible to draw broader conclusions. There is mention of the facility housing a VI but we recently learned that its code degraded to such an extent that we cannot reactivate it. However, there is hope we could reactive something, a large obelisk like structure that sits in the center of the main room and has remained nearly perfectly preserved. It is has been powered off but we strongly believe that there is a way to activate it from one of the terminals."

 btr_site.105.desc:0 "We have learned all there is to learn here. The databases have been downloaded onto our equipment and we are preparing to make them public once we return home. The facility was largely devoid of any items small enough to carry with just the structures and larger objects being left to their fate. After nearly constant efforts we found the way to activate the strange obelisk which appears to be some form of long-range communication link but we don't have the equipment or the technical experience to study how it works. It is portable, similar to a fridge, but we recommend it be studied in place. Who knows what sort of immense knowledge is contained both in its storage and in its design."
