 mec_eg_site.20911.desc:0 "Our excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have confirmed that the burial ground is in fact Prothean. Most importantly, our team has identified no signs of looting or interference, meaning this site is one of a few in the galaxy that has been undisturbed for 50,000 years. Understandably, this has led to requests from across our civilization to be a part of this archaeological dig. \n\nCurrently, our excavation team are focused on surveying and securing the site, ensuring that the entire area is thoroughly examined before any further research is undertaken. Additional security personnel are being requested by [Root.GetLeaderName] due to the scientific and material value of the site."

 mec_eg_site.20912.desc:0 "Following extensive surveys of the entire planet, [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported that there are over two hundred graves on [From.Planet.GetName]. A small number of the graves have been examined in detail, with samples being taken from the remains and various artifacts being catalogued. \n\nFrom these initial artifacts, a clearer picture has emerged. All of the graves so far are that of soldiers or soldier equivalents, adorned in a ceremonial armor with a rifle and blade alongside them. It would not be prudent to assume that the Protheans were inherently a militarist civilization, but from what has been examined it is safe to argue that their soldiers were given a high level of respect. \n\nThree graves in particular are extremely important in our understanding of the Protheans. The remains within these graves are of a different species, with four upper appendages and two lower, standing and locomotion limbs. They are distinctly smaller than the dominant species. The most numerous species are humanoid, with what appear to be two pairs of eye sockets in their skull. \n\nBased on the gravesites it is clear that both species were buried respectfully and equally. There are no indications that one species was higher on the social hierarchy within this context. \n\nThe research team's next step is to analyse any and all genetic samples, as well as carefully examine the remaining graves. \n\nAdditionally, [Root.GetLeaderName] has added an addendum to their report, saying that it has been found that [From.Planet.GetName] is rich in high value minerals and element zero. Exploiting these resources may be beneficial following our excavation."

 mec_eg_site.20913.desc:0 "The excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have uncovered a highly unique gravesite. Underneath the body of a humanoid Prothean, adorned in a flight-suit with a sidearm and various other artifacts, was a buried starfighter. The starfighter was painted in gunmetal grey with bright green highlights along the fuselage, wings and weapon hardpoints. There are clear marks near the cockpit indicating the pilot's kill count which number at forty-one. It is therefore likely that being buried with one's starfighter was a great honor for any pilot. The lack of other remains clothed in a flight suit is an intriguing oddity. \n\nIt is still unclear if the graves are all from a singular battle or conflict, nor is it clear why [From.Planet.GetName] is the final resting place of these soldiers. This is especially true due to the complete lack of evidence suggesting any kind of conflict took place in the local system. \n\nThe starfighter itself has been meticulously scanned and has offered some intriguing insights in regards to it's reactor core and shielding technology. Our science teams are already investigating possible improvements to our fighter-craft and other starships."

[Root.GetLeaderName] has confirmed that the humanoid species have a unique DNA structure. The majority of known life in the galaxy uses the double-helix DNA structure, whereas the humanoid Protheans have a quad-strand DNA structure, It is speculated that quad-strand DNA has in-built functions similar to epigenetic markers as well as being involved in the reading of genetic code and the production of proteins. \nFurthermore, some distinct variations have been identified between the humanoid species, however, what these distinctions mean and how they'd represent themselves is impossible to know. \n\nUnfortunately, all the genetic samples taken from the other species are too damaged to analyse.

 btr_asari_site_prothean_beacon_intro_asari_desc:0 "For as long as the Asari have existed on Thessia there has been a giant ancient artifact looming over them. The primitive Asari that lived in the area told tales of strange being leaving the artifact behind after staying in the region and teaching them various ways to improve their lives. These tales propagated across the planet taking on a life of their own as civilization began to develop on the world. \n \nWhoever speaks with the artifact owns Thessia."
 btr_site.101.name:0 "The Interface of a God"
 btr_site.101.desc:0 "The primitive states that began to form as the Asari moved into its ancient era knew of the Pillar and often strove to control it. It rapidly took on a religious function as the ancient stories morphed into doctrines which coalesced around “The Goddess”. The Pillar was understood as a gift from the Goddess, a gift that required enough faith and understanding to fully appreciate."

 btr_site.102.name:0 "The Secret takes hold"
 btr_site.102.desc:0 "As time went on the religion solidified as the largest faith on Thessia and the time each nation possessed the gift got longer. Eventually it was realized that there would only ever be conflict over controlling the gift. The now highly powerful religious leadership decided it was best to hide the gift away and begin teaching the masses that it was not a physical gift as many believed. They embarked on a project of erecting a massive statue of the Goddess with the ancient pillar as its core. \n \n We cannot use the Goddesses gift if we are all dead."

Yet the highest echelons of their religious leaders knew different and were using small groups of trusted subordinates to do quietly do research on the pillar. While the nations that controlled the gift had done rudimentary research into it they had only controlled it for decades or a century at most.

However, its very design and the materials it is made out of have given rise to numerous inventions and its power supply has been extremely inspiring. As the Asari explore other areas of space, they have encountered technologies left by some other civilization that seem strangely compatible with designs derived from the Gift."

 btr_site.107.name:0 "The Entrance"
 btr_site.107.desc:0 "Apparently the buildings that the soldiers had taken shelter in were in fact the upper floors of several large towers that were part of the facility. We estimate that these towers stood about 15 meters tall with all except the upper floor being buried. Once we cleared away the dirt and debris in the towers, we were able to access much of its internal stairwells and hallways which are remarkably well preserved. Unfortunately, none of our exploration of the towers has revealed any artifacts or pieces of technology yet."

We have also begun expanding out into the rest of the base with two smaller buildings being discovered. From what has been found we know that this outpost was a research facility meant to maintain its operations classified and mitigate risk to important areas should their experiments go wrong. What they were researching or what they discovered remains elusive."

We have uncovered many of the buildings but not fully explored them and the tunnels remain completely unknown to us. The towers are completely catalogued but unfortunately there is painfully little information left. All we have learned is that this facility was set up in a hurry and was focused on weapons research, but it was always understaffed and struggling for equipment. Shortly after its creation it was abandoned without ever becoming fully operational."

 btr_site.110.name:0 "The Discovery"
 btr_site.110.desc:0 "The smaller buildings have been fully surveyed and revealed little we did not already know. They appeared to be mostly barracks for the workers and a command building that was stripped of everything but the walls when the base was abandoned. We then began exploring the tunnels and it seems this was where the main experimentation was going on. There were examples of multiple types of weapon impacts on the walls and also a strange computer like device. It appears to be functional although we aren't sure how to use it and it is very large, larger than any terminal we have seen in other Prothean ruins. We believe that this size is why it was left in the tunnels because of the urgency with which they abandoned the base meant they did not have the time to demolish one of the buildings and extricate this device."

But due to its hot and uninhabitable nature it has been ignored with only a small collection of probes left in orbit to monitor it. No one had anticipated these probes to ever report anything of note outside of some academic study. Today we were proven incorrect in our assumptions; two of the probes reported the same anomalous reading from the surface of the planet. According to our study of the readings the probes indicate that something is emitting an intermittent signal from the planet surface but there is too much interference to determine what it is. Our scientists are able to confirm that the signal must be extremely powerful to pierce the interference and there is a high likelihood of it being artificial due how the signal has been behaving. \n \nWe must look into such a strange situation."

The second generation of robot explorers passed their fallen predecessors and discovered the source of the signal. It is a large machine that appears to be some form of computer. We do not know who placed it on the planet or when and we cannot answer the questions without retrieving it. Unfortunately, we did not plan on retrieving anything from the surface so we will need a third expedition to take the strange item off the surface."

With a specially designed shuttle and a new compliment of the second-generation robots we were able to recover the device along with the damaged group from the second expedition and the remains of the first expedition. We have brought the device to a research institute where all citadel species can study the device and help unlock its secrets. The robots have been repaired and returned to service with the first expedition being laid to rest in a museum."

 btr_site.115.name:0 "Completion"
 btr_site.115.desc:0 "The research into the device has not gone as we had hoped. The science teams were able to confirm that Lenuamund was not always as it is now and that at some point it was a world similar to Earth or Thessia but It lost its atmosphere. Outside of that we have not been able to learn much about the device and none of our attempts to wake it from its standby mode have been successful. We believe that it is sending out a signal searching for a satellite which would then activate the device, but all of its satellites were lost when the atmosphere dissipated. Why it has only recently begun sending out the signal in an attempt to wake itself up is unknown and unfortunately it most likely never will be discovered."

Yet despite these sites existing for our entire history many of them are not well understood or explored. While some fear that attempting to catalogue such sites may cause unrest among our people, but others are adamant that this is what the Enkindlers would have wanted.

The exploration of these ruins has caused much more disturbance at home than the more remote sites but have given us far greater rewards. There is clear evidence at many of these facilities that large amounts of ancient Hanar lived in specialized quarters within the campuses.

The discoveries this time have not been as unprecedented as before, but the teams did remote several oddities in their investigations. The Hanar barracks within many of these facilities have a large amount of dining material, similar in abundance to what we would expect from the Enkindler areas. This is strange as our people do not eat in the same way as the land-based species. This has led some to theorize that at one point our species may have resembled the bipeds of our current age."

A functioning Enkindler device, it seems to be a computer of some description but our studies of the device are superficial at present.

From what we understand of their technology their ships were not capable of FTL travel but relied on the massive constructs to send them across space. The facilities power source has also been uncovered; it is some form of arcane reactor that we don't understand.

Many of our people have travelled to these planets to honor these ancients that had such impact on our modern state. Typically, these pilgrims stay in orbit either on their ships or a series of small stations that function as museums. Recently we have received word that a group of these tourists have ignored this tradition and landed on the planet of Bira as the main planet Verush is a gas giant. They travelled across the planet and came upon a rift in the ground which was large enough to block their path. When they looked into the rift they saw, rooms, strange glowing dim lights, and strange patterns they couldn't recognize.

It is a small room that has been shifted and crumbled by the tectonic forces on the planet with most of the entries and several of the walls being almost completely destroyed. They were able to rappel through what would have been the ceiling had it still existed. Reportedly the room was barren with no furniture or items inside it but the walls were inlaid with some form of light source that emitted a subtle green glow, how this is power remains a mystery.

Preliminary scouting of the surrounding area has also failed to find anything of note.

The upper floor did in fact hold several smaller items which we have sent to the home world for study. The lower level isn't completely finished being uncovered but the room we have cleared had several terminals that still had power. While we cannot read the language that the terminals use, we have begun cataloguing them in hopes of translating it later on. This has rejuvenated the team who are rapidly clearing the other rooms on this lower floor."

 btr_site.129.desc:0 "Upon completion of clearing the second level we discovered another pathway into an even lower level. We believe that this level was always underground and functioned as a smaller basement area although we have not even begun digging through the stairwell to understand what it was used for. The second level has revealed nearly a dozen terminals in total which will hopefully give us incredible amount of information once our linguists decode the language and allow us to read these files. There were also smaller items that appeared to be auxiliary items for the terminals or possibly items that helped the people who used these terminals in their jobs outside of the terminals."

 btr_site.130.desc:0 "The excavation of the bottom most level has uncovered a wealth of items. It appears that this floor was left alone while the rest of the building was being evacuated and as such it has been entombed here for potentially millennia. Lockers, chests, cupboards, terminals, and more were all left to sit unused forever. Unfortunately, many of the items were damaged or destroyed when the building was toppled and subsumed by the planet but even, they may yield important information. One oddity that we cannot explain is some form of upright computer that has been thrown from its mount and lays in a corner of the disorienting funhouse that the building has become. Whatever information required such a large and advanced supercomputer must have been incredibly important considering their terminals appear to be extremely advanced already. Considering it has already been moved we are planning on taking it and bringing it back to the home-world with the other items after the excavation is completed."

The Satu Arrd system in our space is known for its immense Eezo mines which have been a substantial boon for our economy. However, some have argued that the focus on the Eezo mines, which exist primarily on one planet, has blinded us to the potential of the rest of the system. They are requesting permission to conduct a more in depth survey of the other planets which have been ignored so far. \n \nIt's their finances on the line."

Something is buried under the surface of the planet, what's confusing is that we would expect a resource deposit to be further from the surface. It is also relatively small which probably lead earlier surveys to just ignore it. However, our readings indicate that this is more than a mineral deposit as we have reason to believe there are voids within this anomalous zone."

Using robotic miners and automated systems it is progressing rapidly but has not found anything out of the ordinary. The story of Rilar's mystery has become something of a phenomenon among citadel species with theories about what is buried under the surface of Rilar drowning out most other content on various forums and sites."

The automated systems will be retired, and a corps of archeologists and organic works will be brought in to continue the excavation in a gentler, more delicate fashion. So far all we know is that the item uncovered but the robots is part of a larger item which is still buried. From the size of it, the team believes it is a part of a buried structure, but its orientation, design, or purpose cannot be determined until more of the soil can be removed."

The renewed excavation has focused on following the item and clearing away the soil around it. We now know that it is a building and we have been able to enter it to discover primarily storage of various mechanical parts, presumably for terrestrial and atmospheric vehicles that would have been based nearby. Because of this the team has begun working on finding other buildings that may be part of some form of outpost or settlement."

A total of ten buildings were uncovered and searched, the majority of them being either barracks or some form of vehicle bays. Unfortunately, these buildings tended to have the remains of dead aliens, we cannot identify the species, but we believe it to be Prothean. It appears that this outpost was a maintenance and crew recovery station for mining activities in the system but one day their supply ships stopped arriving and everyone at the outpost starved shortly thereafter. There was a command and control building which housed much of the entries that shed light on the events that transpired here. Currently three separate movies are in production depicting the plight of the staff here. What isn't known to the public is the recovery of a large device that was at the center of the command-and-control center, it is clearly mechanical and functional, but its operation is a mystery to us, and its purpose remains unknown."

 btr_asari_site_prothean_beacon_intro_sal_desc:0 "While there has been a general knowledge about the rare features on the planet of Judor IV for some time now, only upon a closer examination of these features did we learn to be more curious. The famous glacial rivers are actually artificial canals which appear to have been abandoned around the same time as the Protheans disappeared. Our working theory is that the Protheans constructed the canals for reasons we cannot currently understand. Something that has attracted so many of our scientists is how pristine the canals appear to be. While the ice has overflown the walls of the canals, underneath the ice the canals seem to perfect preserved despite not having been maintained in millennia. \n \nWe could have many uses for maintenance free infrastructure."
 btr_site.136.name:0 "A Frozen Past"
 btr_site.136.desc:0 "Excavating a site buried under tens of meters of solid ice is not easy, especially when we must remain careful not to damage the canals underneath. Yet we were successful, with a combination or hard work and specially designed equipment we have cleared away enough of the ice to stand on top of the canal walls. While this hasn't told us much about the materials that were used, or the techniques, or the technology, it is an important milestone."

 btr_site.138.desc:0 "There has been an incredible breakthrough in our study of the metallic walls and floor of this canal. It is a unique alloy that is primarily made of metals that we already know of and understand, how they are combined into this alloy that has properties none of them alone possess. Despite our current ignorance of how these metals were combined, knowing the ingredients gives us the ability to experiment. We have also shifted our tunnelling operations in an effort to find any surplus resources or possibly onsite forges."

 btr_site.139.desc:0 "Our excavation teams have discovered a room hidden behind a panel built into the wall of the canal. It appears that this room was used as housing for the workers while this was being constructed and then as storage and logistics once the construction moved further away. We have not fully explored this large chamber but we have recovered a number of artifacts including some samples of the greenish-blue metal that makes up the canal. We are going to be focusing on exploring this chamber for the foreseeable future."

 btr_site.140.desc:0 "In the back of the chamber we found it. A massive machine, our current hypothesis is a supercomputer of a design far beyond anything we have even theorized. It appears that this back area of the chamber had been converted into a form of command center for the build site after the barracks was moved closer to where the work was being done. Next to nothing of use is left, the terminals are all broken and many of the other devices are so arcane we cannot begin to understand if they are operation or not. But the computer, it is working, it glows with a faint green light and quietly hums, we aren't sure why it was left behind when they sealed this area off but perhaps our future study can shed light on that topic as well."

 btr_site_collective_archeology_site_intro_desc:0 "Long ago our people discovered a strange world in our early travels into the stars. While Diamonds are not rare on the worlds we inhabit, having an entire planet composed of diamond is something that attracted the attention of our scientists. A small team has been investigating this world for some time and has recently made a startling discovery. The world could not have formed naturally, while whatever did this to the planet destroyed any evidence of its past, our simulations have proven that no natural process could have created it. Why some past civilization decided to do this to the world is unclear to us, diamonds are not rare enough to require turning a whole planet into diamond to acquire large quantities. Perhaps there is a use for Diamond that we are not aware of which warranted such a massive investment and sacrifice. Whatever the answer, the only way to find out is to study the planet closer and search for evidence of whatever did alter the planet so radically.\n\nThere must be a reason to this madness"
 btr_site.150.name:0 "Signs of Destruction"
 btr_site.150.desc:0 "The team that we have dispatched to Fumimi has issued their preliminary report on the planet. The world is well disguised, with impact craters being so large it is difficult to believe that they are artificial. Currently we are unsure what could have done this to a planet. Simply throwing various asteroids at the world would not have achieved this effect. We also are still unclear what purpose turning this world into a gem served. However, the team has set about using various forms of scans to try and map out the planet beneath its diamond surface. Perhaps a deep cave network survived the process and can give us insight into what the world was, perhaps it can even explain what apocalyptic technology allowed this civilization to desecrate a world so thoroughly. For now though, the answers lay beneath the semi-reflective surface of the slain world."

There are three large voids in the planet, extremely deep within its crust, and almost perfectly rectangular. Even those of us less scientifically inclined could tell from the images of the scans that these rectangular voids were in fact artificially created. It is possible that whatever civilization did this to the planet was subterranean like us and this was where they lived. While the chambers are large, larger than the majority of our single chambers, they are disconnected and far apart, unlike our extremely interconnected chambers. There is no clear way to reach these chambers either, which is puzzling for a subterranean civilization.

Our peoples experience with tunneling proved crucial in getting this project completed in a reasonable amount of time despite the difficulties with mining through solid diamond. As we had predicted, the chambers are in fact rooms clearly built by some alien civilization with technology that is largely unknown to us. The room has power with bright blue lights illuminating the strange, purple-gray metal that was used to build the room and also many of the machines inside of it. There is not much space despite the fact that the room is immense, because the majority of it is taken up by a massive wall of strange, triangular boxes protruding from an otherwise smooth wall. The boxes are oriented with one pointing up and another pointing down directly next to it with a small gap before the next pair. The boxes have alien symbols that glow with the blue light although we cannot understand them. Using the small hallway that runs along the strange wall our team has set up a new camp from which they will begin studying these boxes, the alien metals, and how this room is powered."

 btr_site.153.desc:0 "With long hours of careful study, we have come to the conclusion that the strange boxes are in fact a form of cryostasis. A technology that has until now been purely hypothetical to our people. This has presented several challenges to our researchers. Due to the largely intact nature of the chamber it is very likely that whoever is inside these chambers is still alive, waiting to be reawakened. However, since we do not know why they went into these chambers we can't be sure that awakening them would not put them in danger. We also don't understand how the technology works, or how it is controlled. So ripping one of the triangles out of the wall could be catastrophic. In the top left corner of the room there was a minor cave in which may have destroyed some of the pods. None of the team has been able to reach such heights as whoever constructed this room left no stairs, or ladders, or ramps and it is unclear how those in the upper pods would have been awakened without falling to their deaths. The team claims to have several possible plans that they will begin working on before their next report is due."

We also have gained access to the broken pods at the top of the wall as well. The creatures are little more than dried bones at this point, but it appears they were tall, with robust bones that indicate they may have been quite strong and bulky in life. Unfortunately our studies of the pods has revealed that they were an illusion all along. Instead of preserving the inhabitants of the pods, they froze them to death and for some time preserved their corpses but after the millenia the already nonfunctioning pods proved incapable of even this token gesture. Once the became clear, we removed several pods and studied them further and learned that while the technology is impressive and incredibly advanced, it is not complete. It appears that they were built using incomplete designs, or designs that were unfamiliar to them. The various forms of technology are so disparate that the team believes that the owners of these pods stole them from another advanced race before they were completed and then failed to properly finish them. We will likely never understand why they did so, or why they failed to test the pods before using them so extensively."
