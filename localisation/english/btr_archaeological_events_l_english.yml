 mec_eg_anomaly.2090.desc:0 "During a survey of [From.Planet.GetName], our research team identified a burial ground of some sort, possibly Prothean. Unsurprisingly, a number of xeno-archaeologists are requesting permission to investigate the burial ground and why an atmosphere-less, barren rock was chosen as a final resting place."

 mec_eg_site.20911.desc:0 "Our excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have confirmed that the burial ground is in fact Prothean. Most importantly, our team has identified no signs of looting or interference, meaning this site is one of a few in the galaxy that has been undisturbed for 50,000 years. Understandably, this has led to requests from across our civilization to be a part of this archaeological dig. \n\nCurrently, our excavation team are focused on surveying and securing the site, ensuring that the entire area is thoroughly examined before any further research is undertaken. Additional security personnel are being requested by [Root.GetLeaderName] due to the scientific and material value of the site."

 mec_eg_site.20912.name:0 "Examining the Dead"
 mec_eg_site.20912.desc:0 "Following extensive surveys of the entire planet, [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported that there are over two hundred graves on [From.Planet.GetName]. A small number of the graves have been examined in detail, with samples being taken from the remains and various artifacts being catalogued. \n\nFrom these initial artifacts, a clearer picture has emerged. All of the graves so far are that of soldiers or soldier equivalents, adorned in a ceremonial armor with a rifle and blade alongside them. It would not be prudent to assume that the Protheans were inherently a militarist civilization, but from what has been examined it is safe to argue that their soldiers were given a high level of respect. \n\nThree graves in particular are extremely important in our understanding of the Protheans. The remains within these graves are of a different species, with four upper appendages and two lower, standing and locomotion limbs. They are distinctly smaller than the dominant species. The most numerous species are humanoid, with what appear to be two pairs of eye sockets in their skull. \n\nBased on the gravesites it is clear that both species were buried respectfully and equally. There are no indications that one species was higher on the social hierarchy within this context. \n\nThe research team's next step is to analyse any and all genetic samples, as well as carefully examine the remaining graves. \n\nAdditionally, [Root.GetLeaderName] has added an addendum to their report, saying that it has been found that [From.Planet.GetName] is rich in high value minerals and element zero. Exploiting these resources may be beneficial following our excavation."

 mec_eg_site.20913.name:0 "Buried Fighter"
 mec_eg_site.20913.desc:0 "The excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] have uncovered a highly unique gravesite. Underneath the body of a humanoid Prothean, adorned in a flight-suit with a sidearm and various other artifacts, was a buried starfighter. The starfighter was painted in gunmetal grey with bright green highlights along the fuselage, wings and weapon hardpoints. There are clear marks near the cockpit indicating the pilot's kill count which number at forty-one. It is therefore likely that being buried with one's starfighter was a great honor for any pilot. The lack of other remains clothed in a flight suit is an intriguing oddity. \n\nIt is still unclear if the graves are all from a singular battle or conflict, nor is it clear why [From.Planet.GetName] is the final resting place of these soldiers. This is especially true due to the complete lack of evidence suggesting any kind of conflict took place in the local system. \n\nThe starfighter itself has been meticulously scanned and has offered some intriguing insights in regards to it's reactor core and shielding technology. Our science teams are already investigating possible improvements to our fighter-craft and other starships."

 mec_eg_site.20914.name:0 "DNA Structure"
 mec_eg_site.20914.desc:0 "Our science team have had a major breakthrough on [From.Planet.GetName] in respect to biological samples taken from the graves. [Root.GetLeaderName] has confirmed that the humanoid species have a unique DNA structure. The majority of known life in the galaxy uses the double-helix DNA structure, whereas the humanoid Protheans have a quad-strand DNA structure, It is speculated that quad-strand DNA has in-built functions similar to epigenetic markers as well as being involved in the reading of genetic code and the production of proteins. \nFurthermore, some distinct variations have been identified between the humanoid species, however, what these distinctions mean and how they'd represent themselves is impossible to know. \n\nUnfortunately, all the genetic samples taken from the other species are too damaged to analyse. Our research team will continue excavating the area for any additional artifacts and information."

 mec_eg_site.20915.desc:0 "No further artifacts and information of note has been identified by our research team on [From.Planet.GetName]. As noted by [Root.GetLeaderName] previously, the detailed survey of the planet identified the presence of high value minerals, including element zero. This information has now become public knowledge, and a variety of mining organizations and corporations are requesting permission to set-up camps to explore the feasibility of mining the area. \n\nAs one would expect, a significant number of scientists are demanding that [From.Planet.GetName] is declared a planet of galactic heritage. A decision is needed as to the future of the planet."

Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is planning to remove both from the planet if they cannot improve their work ethic. A temporary halt to progress is expected no matter the outcome."

Clearly desiring the immense archaeological wealth for the blackmarket, they were fortunately repulsed by our security forces. Whilst none of the archaeological team were injured, a few security personnel were killed in the attack. Further security arrangements are being made to ensure such an event cannot occur again."
