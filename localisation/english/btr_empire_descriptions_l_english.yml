Every citizen from age 15 to 30 serves the state in some capacity, as anything from a soldier to an administrator, from a construction engineer to a sanitation worker. Turians have a strong inclination toward public service and self-sacrifice, so they tend to be poor entrepreneurs. To compensate, they accepted the mercantile Volus as a client race, offering protection in exchange for their fiscal expertise."

 origin_vol_protectorate_desc:0 "A client race of the Turian Hierarchy, the Vol Protectorate represents the Volus in galactic affairs.\n\nThey hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support an ammonia-based biochemistry.

 origin_quarian_conclave:0 "Quarian Conclave"
 origin_quarian_conclave_desc:0 "For three centuries our people have been confined to the Migrant Fleet after being forced to flee our old homeworld of Rannoch. Our once proud flotilla is now full of ships showing their age, constant repairs an endless strain on our resources. A single ruptured fuel line could cost thousands of lives if we aren't careful. Furthermore, our population is in constant flux combating overpopulation and plagues at every turn. Citizens are also beginning to question why they should send their youth out on pilgrimages when the risks are increasingly greater than the rewards. It is becoming very clear we cannot rely on the Rayya, Shellen, and (ship name X) nor the fruits of pilgrimages for our survival forever. With Rannoch and the rest of the Tikkun system firmly in Geth control, it might be time to turn away from our ancestral birthright for a solution.\n\nHaving served in the Conclave admirably, you have just become the newest member of the Admiralty Board. Currently, the Board stands more divided than ever before. Some Admirals believe every effort must be made in retaking the homeworld, the infrastructure already there was worth any potential losses in a war with the Geth. This is an emotional argument as well, Rannoch is our homeworld, and to so easily move on to a different planet is unthinkable to many. Our current military strength is no match for the Geth, however, it has been proposed if we are willing to make sacrifices that we could convert civilian vessels into a fleet capable of challenging the Consensus. In contrast, several other Admirals believe in this time of crisis our sentimentality should be abandoned in exchange for practical necessity. They propose sending scout ships amongst the stars in order to discover a new world we can call home. As the newest member of the Admiralty Board, you alone hold the swing vote. \n\nThe future of our people is in your hands alone. Keelah Se'lai."
