 mec_eg_site.20311.desc:0 "Our research team on [From.Planet.GetName] have confirmed that the ruins are that of the Protheans. The Protheans were a precursor civilization that are presumed to have monitored a number of the current advanced species across the galaxy and are responsible for many of the galaxy's wonders. \n\nFortunately the ruins across the planet seem to be in relatively good condition, despite 50,000 years of deterioration, though our excavation team have identified signs of looting and unregulated mining operations. Due to the extensive network of ruins it is hoped that the ruins can offer a unique insight into the Protheans, their civilization and their sudden disappearance. \n\nInitial estimates by our research team suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was once an established colony world for the Protheans, with a population in the tens of millions, that was likely focused on mineral extraction and refinement."
 mec_eg_site.20311.a:0 "An amazing find!"

 mec_eg_site.20312.name:0 "Following the Rubble"
 mec_eg_site.20312.desc:0 "Our ongoing excavations of various habitat centers across [From.Planet.GetName] is continuing efficiently. A wide range of artifacts have already been catalogued by our archaeologists. Some of these artifacts are simple tools for everyday use, whilst others seem to be entirely foreign to us. It is possible that some of these artifacts are personal objects, such as religious icons, but it is nigh impossible to confirm. \n\nWhilst the majority of electronic devices have deteriorated to the point of being useless, a few are still functioning. Thanks to the assistance of some of our greatest xeno-linguistic and technology experts, they have identified the location of a control center of some sort. A research team is enroute to the coordinates to begin preliminary excavation. \n\nScience officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has noted that despite evidence pointing to [From.Planet.GetName] being a major colony world for the Protheans, there is a distinct absence of Prothean remains. It is possible that the Protheans cremated their dead, or perhaps moved them offworld, but it seems unlikely that all Protheans followed such traditions. An interesting curiosity to ponder."

 mec_eg_site.20313.name:0 "Prothean Control Center"
 mec_eg_site.20313.desc:0 "Our research teams have successfully found and entered the Prothean control center. As expected much of the installation is inoperable, however, a number of terminals still have some power. Thankfully our remote power generators are suitable battery back-ups and have ensured that we can continue our investigation unimpeded. \n\nWhilst our research team have managed to successfully access a variety of data-banks within the installation, much of the data has been corrupted and the data they have managed to access is not as exciting as many of our research team hoped for. Nonetheless, the data provides a window into the day-to-day lives of Protheans 50,000 years ago, including weather information, inbound and outbound ships and upcoming important events. \n\nUnfortunately, the ship logs have been corrupted to the point that information on point of origin and destination are not available. As one can imagine, such information would be a major discovery. Of interest however, is the data on the planet's weather. It has been revealed that the average temperature on [From.Planet.GetName] was much cooler 50,000 years ago, and was subject to higher levels of precipitation. Science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has authorized a mission to collect ice cores as a means to study the climatic history of the planet. \n\nOur research team will also continue searching and analysing all the data available within the control center for the foreseeable future."

 mec_eg_site.20314.desc:0 "Following the revelation that that [From.Planet.GetName] may not have once been as arid as it is today, our research team have obtained ice cores, from the planet's poles. Unfortunately they have not been able to provide much information on [From.Planet.GetName]'s climatic history beyond the previous 10,000 years. This is partially due to the planet's average temperature being 59 degrees Celsius. As the planet is so tectonically unstable, it is likely that that is responsible for [From.Planet.GetName]'s climatic shift. \n\nOne outlandish theory by a junior researcher suggested that the colony was subject to a major attack leading to atmospheric changes as a result of mass particulate ejection into the atmosphere. Their theory was quickly dismissed due to the lack of evidence, particularly, the lack of uniform kinetic impacts that would be expected from such an attack."
 mec_eg_site.20314.a:0 "Interesting, but most definitely frustrating."

 mec_eg_site.20315.desc:0 "Despite our continued efforts across [From.Planet.GetName] to acquire more information and data, our excavation team have simply ran out of avenues of investigation. Unfortunately, the the fate of the Protheans on this planet will remain a mystery. /n/nDespite this though, our research team have learnt much about the Prothean language, architecture and [From.Planet.GetName]’s past. This expedition was certainly not a waste, but perhaps the answers on the Prothean’s disappearance will be found elsewhere."

The majority of our initial surveys are of the upper levels of the Prothean megalopolis as the ground is congested by a dozen meters of detritus and with significantly poorer air quality. \n\nNonetheless our efforts have identified artifacts which confirm the presence of multiple species on [From.Planet.GetName] indicating that the Protheans were a multi-species civilization. It is not yet clear how the Protheans organized as a government and society, but [Root.GetLeaderName] is hopeful that [From.Planet.GetName] will hold the answers. \n\nOne thing that is abundantly clear, however, is that we are not the first to visit this world. Evidence of looting is plain to see. \n\nA final word of note is that whilst the planet is habitable, there is little open ground for agriculture, and the only sizable fresh water sources are the poles, which are tapped by the decaying prothean aqueduct system. Major efforts would have to be taken to revitalise the planet."

This information will be highly beneficial as our growing civilization expands. \n\nFurthermore, [Root.GetLeaderName] and their research team have identified distinct architectural eras on [From.Planet.GetName]. Based on these architectural eras, the research team have estimated that the planet was a Prothean colony for around 7,000 to 10,000 years with eighteen distinct eras. \nThe changes in architectural style are very apparent, with buildings constructed in early eras being functional yet decorative, with sweeping arcs and ornamental features. It is clear that as time progressed, later eras favored functionalism with the most recent buildings and arcologies being highly simplistic in their design. \n\nUnsurprisingly, this shift coincided with the time-period in which the Protheans seemingly vanished. What must have happened during that period to cause such a shift within the Prothean civilization?"

As a result, we have carried out extensive analysis of the local region and have identified a number of previously overlooked sites. What we originally thought to be the remnants of collapsed buildings  by looting are in fact hastily cleared landing zones. \nExcavation of these landing zones have revealed an assortment of artifacts, which include personal items, cargo and even some non-functional weapon systems. \n\nIt is clear that [From.Planet.GetName] was abandoned during a period of great emergency, though it is still unknown as to what was the cause. It is hoped that some form of computer system is still operational but it is looking less and less likely as time goes on."

These computers have very little information in regards to the reasoning for evacuation but they do provide details on the number of individuals being evacuated and methods in which to maintain communication. \n\nFirstly, based on the data from these terminals that an estimated five hundred million people were evacuated from [From.Planet.GetName], however, based on the size and development of the planet there were likely hundreds of millions more left behind. The distinct lack of Prothean remains raises numerous questions as to what happened to the remaining population. \nOne theory, that would ordinarily be considered unlikely, is that the remaining population committed mass suicide. Another, is that the remaining population were moved off world at a later date, but no records have been found to suggest further evacuations took place. \n\nSecondly, we have confirmed that following the evacuation of [From.Planet.GetName], critical information was to be sent via the beacons. Prothean beacons are a highly advanced communication system which were used to send critical information across the Prothean civilization. It is likely that any intact Prothean beacon will hold the answers to the disappearance of these precursors. It is now imperative that one is found."

A small number of the graves have been examined in detail, with samples being taken from the remains and various artifacts being catalogued. \n\nFrom these initial artifacts, a clearer picture has emerged. All of the graves so far are that of soldiers or soldier equivalents, adorned in a ceremonial armor with a rifle and blade alongside them. It would not be prudent to assume that the Protheans were inherently a militarist civilization, but from what has been examined it is safe to argue that their soldiers were given a high level of respect. \n\nThree graves in particular are extremely important in our understanding of the Protheans. The remains within these graves are of a different species, with four upper appendages and two lower, standing and locomotion limbs. They are distinctly smaller than the dominant species. The most numerous species are humanoid, with what appear to be two pairs of eye sockets in their skull. \n\nBased on the gravesites it is clear that both species were buried respectfully and equally. There are no indications that one species was higher on the social hierarchy within this context. \n\nThe research team's next step is to analyse any and all genetic samples, as well as carefully examine the remaining graves. \n\nAdditionally, [Root.GetLeaderName] has added an addendum to their report, saying that it has been found that [From.Planet.GetName] is rich in high value minerals and element zero.

The starfighter was painted in gunmetal grey with bright green highlights along the fuselage, wings and weapon hardpoints. There are clear marks near the cockpit indicating the pilot's kill count which number at forty-one. It is therefore likely that being buried with one's starfighter was a great honor for any pilot. The lack of other remains clothed in a flight suit is an intriguing oddity. \n\nIt is still unclear if the graves are all from a singular battle or conflict, nor is it clear why [From.Planet.GetName] is the final resting place of these soldiers. This is especially true due to the complete lack of evidence suggesting any kind of conflict took place in the local system. \n\nThe starfighter itself has been meticulously scanned and has offered some intriguing insights in regards to it's reactor core and shielding technology.

Adorning the walls were a number of cylindrical wheels with various icons carved into them, with hundreds more scattered on the floor likely as a result of whatever calamity befell the city. Whilst it is not yet possible to confirm, it is likely that these cylindrical engraved wheels are part of a religious or cultural convention. \n\nAccess to the rest of the city is proving more difficult with various sections flooded or secured behind military grade armor that would require extensive equipment to be deployed and modified for use underwater. The only method available to the survey team is via the main concourse through the pier, which is unfortunately partially flooded. It may take some time to remove the access water."

A large number of ornate signs, that have long since lost power, dot the walls and ceilings undoubtedly highlighting various stores and locations. It must have been an overwhelming sight for any first time visitor during its peak. \n\nWhilst the entranceway from the pier into the marketplace was relatively clear, it quickly became apparent that a number of defensive emplacements had been constructed, all of which are directed at the pier entrance. Within meters of moving past the defensive line, hundreds of skeletons lay strewn across the floor. \n\nInitial examinations of the skeletons have identified them as all belonging to one species, with two dimorphic types. Analysis of the skeletons has revealed that the remains are approximately 50,000 years old, coinciding with the fall of the Protheans. A number of smaller skeletons have also been identified, likely the juvenile of the species all of which have ceremonial blades nearby. It is not yet clear if these juveniles were killed by the others of their species or by suicide, nor is it yet clear if the juveniles were killed in a ritual killing or as a mercy. Whatever the case, it seems likely that whatever situation these people faced, it was desperate. \n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] hopes further answers may lie deeper within the city. However, as the survey team progress further it has become abundantly clear that the inner sections of the city, which also happen to be deeper underwater, are much less secure. Greater care must be taken to ensure that the city is not suddenly breached by the surrounding ocean."

This is further exemplified by the increased use of barricades and armed emplacements located at key junctions. \n\nMost excitingly, however, is the discovery that some parts of the city are still powered including a number of terminals in the government offices. Interestingly our preliminary scans of the sunken city did not reveal any power sources, indicating that the city is able to mask its energy output. \n\nFurther analysis of the various terminals has revealed that the species who called this city home, were known as the Densorin and that 50,000 years ago the city, now known as Atorantisu, came under attack from some unknown threat. Incredibly, the city was equipped with a highly advanced shield that protected the entire city from orbital strikes. In time however, it was realised that relief from allied forces was highly doubtful and that the shield was unlikely to hold for much longer. Furthermore, the senior staff thought that the research they were conducting was of such vital importance that the only option was to forcibly submerge the city. \n\nIn one desperate act, the ballast tanks and non-vital sections of the city were completely flooded whilst all non-essential power was diverted to the city shield. It was hoped that the attacking force would believe their attacks to have destroyed the city, a prayer which was granted. \n\nAlas, the city no longer had enough power to unflood the ballast tanks and non-vital sections. The city was doomed to stay on the ocean floor forever more. Logs following this realisation become sparse as power continues to drain, however, it seems that some measures were taken to extend the cities power. Measures which were clearly successful. \n\nPerhaps of most interest is the fact that the city spire and its research labs were the primary beneficiary of these power conservation efforts, even above that of the life support systems. Whatever research the Densorin were conducting here was considered to be of greater importance than the lives of all of the city's inhabitants."

It is increasingly likely that the many juveniles in this city were killed as part of some ritual, though for what exact purpose is unclear. Perhaps it was a desperate sacrifice, hoping for divine intervention against the attacking force in orbit. A call for aid that was left unanswered. \n\nWhilst we have managed to acquire large swathes of data, the exact nature of the project being undertaken at this location is still unknown. It is possible that a key piece of data is still missing, as so far the data is very broad in scope. Nonetheless the detail and precision on celestial bodies well beyond this installation has revealed new methodologies for us to employ in our sensor systems."

 mec_eg_site.30075.name:0 "Celestial Understanding"
 mec_eg_site.30075.desc:0 "The highly advanced data on celestial mechanics and the fundamental properties of the universe has finally been analyzed and understood. It is clear that the Densorin were interested in the relationship between element zero, dark energy and the forces of the universe. Whilst the data available is not enough for a scientific truth, it does lend credence to the Densorin's theory that the continued use of element zero increases the influence and power dark energy in the universe. This in turn, according to the Densorin, has drastic effects on the stability of the very fabric of space with some Densorin scientists speculating the continued use of element zero would lead to the destabilization of stars. \n\nA relatively minor scientist also postulated that, in theory at least, this destabilization effect could be increased artificially causing stars to go supernova or collapse. The benefit of such an action remains to be seen. Was this the reason for the attack upon the Lost City of Atorantisu? Were the Densorin close to unlocking the potential to develop weapons of celestial destruction? Unfortunately, it seems that we shall never know. \n\nThe Lost City of Atorantisu has revealed much, yet so little, about the city itself and its inhabitants. It is clear that the Densorin were a highly advanced species that co-existed at a time alongside the Protheans. And just like the Protheans, the end of the Densorin's tale will continue to remain unclear."

The dead cities that litter the landscape of this planet, may be in relatively good condition considering their age, but they are unstable and present a major risk due to debris and dust.
